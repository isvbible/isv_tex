\passage{The Word of the \divine{Lord} to Hosea}

\chapt{1}
\v{1}A message from the \divine{Lord} came\fnote{Lit. \fbib{that came}} to Beeri's son Hosea\fnote{The Heb. name \fbib{Hosea} means \fbib{salvation}} during the reigns of\fnote{Lit. \fbib{in the days of}} Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of\fnote{Lit. \fbib{in the days of}} Joash's son Jeroboam, who was king of Israel.
\passage{Hosea's Wife and Family}

\v{2}When a message from the \divine{Lord} came to Hosea, the \divine{Lord} told him,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Hosea}} ``Go marry a prostitute and have children with her,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{children of prostitution}} because the land is prostituting itself by departing from the \divine{Lord}.'' \v{3}So he went out and married Diblaim's daughter Gomer. She conceived with him and gave birth to a son.
\passage{Naming the Children}

\v{4}The \divine{Lord} told Hosea,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} ``Name the child\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Name him}} `Jezreel,'\fnote{The Heb. name \fbib{Jezreel} means ``God sows''} because in a little while I'll avenge the blood that was shed by Jehu's dynasty at Jezreel. I'll put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. \v{5}At that time I'll shatter the military strength\fnote{Lit. \fbib{the bow}} of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.''

\v{6}Gomer\fnote{Lit. \fbib{She}} conceived again and gave birth to a daughter, so the \divine{Lord}\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} told Hosea,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} ``Name her `Lo-ruhamah,'\fnote{The Heb. name \fbib{Lo-ruhamah} means \fbib{No mercy}} because I will no longer be showing mercy to the house of Israel, nor will I forgive them. \v{7}But I'll have mercy on the house of Judah, and I'll save them by the \divine{Lord} their God---I will not save them by the bow, by the sword, by battle, by horses, or by cavalry.''

\v{8}After Gomer\fnote{Lit. \fbib{she}} had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived again and gave birth to a son, \v{9}so the \divine{Lord}\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} told Hosea,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} ``Name him `Lo-ammi,'\fnote{The Heb. name \fbib{Lo-ammi} means \fbib{Not my people}} because you are not my people, and I will not be your God.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{be for you}} \v{10}\fnote{This vs. is 2:1 in MT}Despite this, the number of the people of Israel will be like ocean sand, which can neither be measured nor counted. And the time will come when instead of it being said,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{told them}} `You are not my people,' it will be said,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{told them}} `You are children of the living God.' \v{11}\fnote{This vs. is 2:2 in MT}And the people of Judah and the people of Israel will be united as one. They will appoint for themselves a single leader and will take dominion over\fnote{Lit. \fbib{will go up from}} the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.\chapt{2}
\v{1}\fnote{This vs. is 2:3 in MT, and so throughout the chapter.}So call your brothers `Ammi,'\fnote{Lit. \fbib{My People}} and your sisters `Ruhamah.'\,''\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Beloved}; i.e. in contrast to the names \fbib{Lo-Ruhamah} and \fbib{Lo-Ammi} in vv. 2:6-9}

\v{1}Then the \divine{Lord} told me: ``Go love your wife\fnote{Or \fbib{love a woman}} again, even though she is being loved by another and is committing adultery.

\v{4}Likewise, the people of Israel will dwell a long time\fnote{Lit. \fbib{will live many days}} without a king, without a prince, without sacrifice, without sacred\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{sacred}} pillars, and with neither ephod nor teraphim.\fnote{I.e. images used for divination} \v{5}Afterward, the people of Israel will return and seek the \divine{Lord} their God and David their king.

\begin{poetry}

\poeml \v{2}Swearing, lying, murder, theft, and adultery are rampant, \\

\poeml They will engage in prostitution, \\
