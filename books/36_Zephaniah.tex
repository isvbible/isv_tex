\poeml \v{7}Remain silent in the presence of the Lord \divine{God}, \\

\poeml \v{12}And it will come about that I will search Jerusalem with candles,\fnote{Or \fbib{with oil lamps}} \\
\poemll    punishing the self-satisfied and complacent, \\
\poeml who say to themselves, \\
\poemll    `The \divine{Lord} will do neither good nor evil.' \\
\poeml \v{13}Therefore their possessions will be seized as plunder \\
\poemll    and their homes left in ruins. \\
\poeml They may build houses, \\

\poeml \v{15}That day will be filled with wrath, \\
\poemll    a day of trouble and tribulation, \\
\poeml a day of desolation and devastation, \\
\poemll    a day of doom and gloom, \\
\poeml a day of clouds and shadows,\fnote{Cf. Joel 2:2a} \\
\poeml \v{16}a day of trumpet and battle cry \\
\poemlll       against fortified cites and watch\fnote{Lit. \fbib{corner}} towers. \\

\poemll    their blood will be poured out like dust \\
\poemlll       and their intestines will spill out\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{will spill out}} like manure. \\
\poeml \v{18}Neither their silver nor their gold will deliver them \\
\poemll    in the Day of the \divine{Lord}'s wrath; \\
\poeml but the entire land will be consumed \\
\poemll    by the fire of his jealousy, \\
\poeml for he will bring the inhabitants of the land to a sudden end.''
