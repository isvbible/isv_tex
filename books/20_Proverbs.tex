\poemll    righteousness, justice, and upright living;\fnote{Lit. \fbib{and uprightness}} \\
\poeml \v{4}for giving prudence to the na\"{i}ve, \\
\poemll    and knowledge and discretion to the young. \\
\poeml \v{5}Let the wise listen and increase their\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{their}} learning; \\
\poemll    let the person of understanding receive guidance \\
\poeml \v{6}in understanding proverbs, clever sayings, \\
\poemll    words of the wise, and their riddles.
\passage{The Major Theme}
\poeml \v{7}The fear of the \divine{Lord} is the beginning of knowledge, \\
\poemll    but fools despise wisdom and discipline.\fnote{Or \fbib{instruction}}
\passage{The Minor Theme}
\poeml \v{8}My son, listen to your father's instruction, \\
\poemll    and do not let go of your mother's teaching. \\
\poeml \v{9}They will be a graceful wreath for your head \\
\poemll    and a chain for your neck.
\passage{Avoid Evil Counsel}
\poeml \v{10}My son, if sinners entice you, \\
\poemll    do not consent. \\
\poeml \v{11}If they say, ``Come with us! \\
\poemll    Let's lie in wait for blood; \\
\poemlll       let's ambush some innocent person for no reason at all. \\
\poeml \v{12}Let's swallow them alive like Sheol,\fnote{I.e. the realm of the dead; possibly an allusion to the rebellion of Korah (cf. Num 16:33)} \\
\poemll    and whole like those who go down into the Pit.\fnote{I.e. the place of punishment in the afterlife} \\
\poeml \v{13}We'll find all kinds of valuable wealth, \\
\poemll    and we'll fill our houses with spoil. \\
\poeml \v{14}Throw your lot in with us, \\
\poemll    and all of us will have one purse.'' \\
\poeml \v{15}My son, do not go along with them,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{in the way with them}} \\
\poemll    and keep your feet away from their paths! \\
\poeml \v{16}For they\fnote{Lit. \fbib{For their feet}} run toward evil; \\
\poemll    these enticers\fnote{Lit. \fbib{they}} shed blood without hesitation.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{blood quickly}} \\
\poeml \v{17}Look, it is useless to spread a net in full view of\fnote{Lit. \fbib{in the eyes of}} all the birds, \\
\poeml \v{18}but these people\fnote{Lit. \fbib{they}} lie in wait for their own blood.\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{their own}} \\
\poemlll       They ambush only themselves. \\
\poeml \v{19}Such is the way of all those who seek illicit gain--- \\
\poemll    it takes away the lives of those who possess it.
\passage{The Benefits of Choosing Wisdom}
\poeml \v{20}Wisdom cries out in the street; \\
\poemll    she raises her voice in the public squares. \\
\poeml \v{21}She calls out at the busiest part\fnote{Lit. \fbib{head}} of the noisy streets,\fnote{So MT; LXX Syr Targ read \fbib{and on top of the walls}} \\
\poemll    and at the entrance to the gates of the city she utters her words: \\
\poeml \v{22}``You na\"{i}ve ones, how long will you love naivet\'{e}? \\
\poemll    And how long will scoffers delight in scoffing \\
\poemlll       or fools hate knowledge?'' \\
\poeml \v{23}Return to my correction! \\
\poemll    Look, I will pour out my spirit on you, \\
\poemlll       and I will make my words known to you.
\passage{The Consequences of Refusing Wisdom}
\poeml \v{24}``Because I called out to you and you refused to respond---\fnote{Lit. \fbib{you refused}} \\
\poemll    I appealed,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{I stretched out my hand}} but no one paid attention--- \\
\poeml \v{25}because\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{because}} you neglected all my advice \\
\poemll    and did not want my correction, \\
\poeml \v{26}I will laugh at your calamity. \\
\poemll    I will mock when what you fear\fnote{Lit. \fbib{when your fear}} comes, \\
\poeml \v{27}when what you dread comes like a storm, \\
\poemll    and your calamity comes on like a whirlwind, \\
\poemlll       when distress and anguish come upon you. \\
\poeml \v{28}``Then they will call out to me, \\
\poemll    but I will not answer; \\
\poeml they will seek me diligently, \\
\poemll    but they will not find me. \\
\poeml \v{29}``Because they hated knowledge \\
\poemll    and did not choose the fear of the \divine{Lord}; \\
\poeml \v{30}they did not want my advice, \\
\poemll    and they rejected all my correction. \\
\poeml \v{31}They will eat the fruit\fnote{I.e. experience the consequences} of their way, \\
\poemll    and they will be filled with their own devices. \\
\poeml \v{32}Indeed, the waywardness\fnote{So MT; DSS 4QProv\textsuperscript{a} reads \fbib{narrow-mindedness}; lit. \fbib{the pull of}; LXX reads \fbib{Because they would wrong the na\"{i}ve, they will be murdered}} of the na\"{i}ve will kill them, \\
\poemll    and the complacency of fools will destroy them. \\
\poeml \v{33}``But the person who listens to me will live safely \\
\poemll    and will be secure from the fear of evil.''

\passage{The Benefits of Embracing Wisdom}

\begin{poetry}
\poeml \chapt{2}
\v{1}My son, if you accept my words, \\
\poeml and treasure my instructions\fnote{Lit. \fbib{instructions within you}}--- \\
\poeml \v{2}making your ear attentive to wisdom, \\
\poemll    and turning your heart to understanding--- \\
\poeml \v{3}if, indeed, you call out for insight \\
\poemll    and raise your voice for understanding, \\
\poeml \v{4}if you seek it like silver \\
\poemll    and search for it like hidden treasure, \\
\poeml \v{5}then you will understand the fear of the \divine{Lord} \\
\poemll    and learn to know God. \\
\poeml \v{6}For the \divine{Lord} gives wisdom, \\
\poemll    and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. \\
\poeml \v{7}He stores up sound wisdom for the upright \\
\poemll    and is a shield to those who walk in integrity--- \\
\poeml \v{8}guarding the paths of the just \\
\poemll    and protecting the way of his faithful ones. \\
\poeml \v{9}Then you will understand what is right, just, \\
\poemll    and upright---every good path. \\
\poeml \v{10}For wisdom will enter your heart, \\
\poemll    and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. \\
\poeml \v{11}Discretion\fnote{Or \fbib{Wise planning}} will protect you; \\
\poemll    understanding will watch over you, \\
\poeml \v{12}delivering you from the way of evil, \\
\poemll    from men who speak perverse things, \\
\poeml \v{13}and from those who abandon the right\fnote{Lit. \fbib{straight} or \fbib{upright}} path \\
\poemll    to travel along the ways of darkness; \\
\poeml \v{14}who delight in doing evil, \\
\poemll    and rejoice in the perverseness of evil; \\
\poeml \v{15}whose paths are crooked \\
\poemll    and who are devious in their ways, \\
\poeml \v{16}delivering you from the adulteress, \\
\poemll    from the immoral\fnote{Lit. \fbib{foreign}; i.e. one whose values are foreign to God's Law} woman with her seductive words, \\
\poeml \v{17}someone who abandoned the companion of her youth \\
\poemlll       and forgot the covenant of her God. \\
\poeml \v{18}For her house leads down to death, \\
\poemll    and her paths down to the realm of the dead. \\
\poeml \v{19}None who go to her return, \\
\poeml nor do they reach the paths of life. \\
\poeml \v{20}This is how you will walk in the way of good men \\
\poemll    and will keep to the paths of the righteous. \\
\poeml \v{21}For the upright will live in the land, \\
\poemll    and people of integrity will remain in it. \\
\poeml \v{22}But the wicked will be cut off from the land, \\
\poemll    and the treacherous will be uprooted from it.

\poemll    Bind them around your neck, \\
\poemlll       write them on the tablet of your heart, \\
\poeml \v{4}and find favor and a good reputation\fnote{Lit. \fbib{good judgment} or \fbib{sense}} with God and men. \\
\poeml \v{5}Trust in the \divine{Lord} with all your heart, \\
\poemll    and do not depend on your own understanding. \\
\poeml \v{6}In all your ways acknowledge\fnote{Or \fbib{know}} him, \\
\poemll    and he will make your paths straight. \\
\poeml \v{7}Do not be wise in your own opinion. \\
\poemll    Fear the \divine{Lord} and turn away from evil. \\
\poeml \v{8}This will bring healing to your body, \\

\poeml \v{9}Honor the \divine{Lord} with your wealth \\
\poemll    and with the first\fnote{Or \fbib{best}} of all your produce, \\
\poeml \v{10}so your barns will be filled with abundance, \\
\poemll    and your vats will burst open with new wine. \\
\poeml \v{11}My son, do not reject the \divine{Lord}'s discipline, \\
\poemll    and do not despise his correction, \\
\poeml \v{12}because the \divine{Lord} corrects the person he loves, \\
\poemll    just as a father corrects\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{corrects}} the son he delights in.\fnote{So MT; LXX reads \fbib{loves, and he punishes every son he accepts}}
\passage{Wisdom More Valuable than Riches}
\poeml \v{13}How joyful is the man who finds wisdom, \\

\poemll    and her yield than fine gold. \\
\poeml \v{15}She is more precious than rubies, \\
\poemll    and nothing you desire compares with her. \\
\poeml \v{16}Long life is in her right hand, \\
\poemll    and in her left are riches and honor. \\
\poeml \v{17}Her ways are pleasant ways, \\
\poemll    and all her paths are peaceful. \\
\poeml \v{18}She is a tree of life for those who embrace her, \\
\poemll    and whoever clutches her tightly will be joyful. \\
\poeml \v{19}By wisdom the \divine{Lord} laid the earth's foundations, \\
\poemll    and by understanding he set the heavens in place. \\
\poeml \v{20}By his knowledge the depths broke open, \\
\poemll    and the clouds drip with dew.
\passage{Benefits of Wisdom}
\poeml \v{21}My son, do not let wisdom\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{wisdom}} leave your sight. \\

\poemll    and your foot will not stumble. \\
\poeml \v{24}When you sit\fnote{So LXX; MT reads \fbib{lie}} down, you will not be afraid; \\

\poeml \v{25}Do not be afraid of sudden disaster,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{terror}} \\
\poemll    or the devastation that comes to the wicked. \\

\poemll    and he will keep your foot from being caught.

\poemll    when it is in your power to act. \\
\poeml \v{28}Do not say to your neighbor, \\
\poemll    ``Go, and come back. \\
\poemlll       I will pay you\fnote{Lit. \fbib{it}} tomorrow,'' \\
\poeml when you have cash\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{cash}} with you. \\

\poeml \v{2}I give you sound teaching, \\
\poeml so do not abandon my instruction.\fnote{Or \fbib{law}} \\
\poeml \v{3}When I was a son to my father, \\

\poeml \v{4}he taught me and told me, \\
\poemll    ``Let your heart fully embrace what I have to say;\fnote{Lit. \fbib{embrace my words}} \\

\poeml \v{15}Avoid it! Don't travel on it! \\
\poemll    Turn away from it, and pass on by. \\
\poeml \v{16}For they cannot sleep unless they are doing evil, \\
\poemll    and they are robbed of their sleep unless they cause someone to stumble. \\
\poeml \v{17}For they eat the bread of wickedness, \\
\poemll    and they drink the wine of violence. \\
\poeml \v{18}The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn \\
\poemll    that grows brighter until the full light of day. \\
\poeml \v{19}But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness, \\
\poemll    and they do not know what they are stumbling over.

\poeml \v{25}Let your eyes look directly ahead; \\
\poemll    fix your gaze straight in front of you. \\

\begin{poetry}
\poeml \chapt{24}
\v{1}Don't be envious of wicked men \\

\poemll    with all sorts of expensive and beautiful goods. \\
\poeml \v{5}A wise man is strong,\fnote{So MT; LXX reads \fbib{Being wise is better than being strong}} \\

\poeml \v{6}For through wise counsel you will wage your war, \\

\poeml \v{7}Wisdom lies beyond reach of the fool; \\
\poemll    he has nothing to say in court.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{in the gate}} \\
\poeml \v{8}The person who plans on doing evil \\

\poemll    your strength is limited.\fnote{Or \fbib{undersized}} \\
\poeml \v{11}Rescue those who are being led away to death, \\

\poemlll       and what you hope for won't be cut short. \\
\poeml \v{15}Don't lie in wait like an outlaw \\

\poemlll       but the wicked stumble into calamity. \\
\poeml \v{17}Don't rejoice when your enemy falls; \\

\begin{poetry}
\poeml \v{2}It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, \\
\poemll    and the glory of kings to investigate a matter. \\
\poeml \v{3}Just as the heavens are high \\
\poemll    and earth is deep, \\
\poemlll       so the heart of a king is unfathomable. \\
\poeml \v{4}Purge the dross from the silver, \\

\poeml \v{5}Purge the wicked from the king's presence, \\
\poemll    and his throne will be established in righteousness. \\
\poeml \v{6}Don't magnify yourself in the presence of a king, \\
\poemll    and don't pretend to be in the company of famous men, \\
\poeml \v{7}for it is better that it be told you, ``Come up here,'' \\
\poemll    than for you to be placed lower \\
\poemlll       in the presence of an official. \\
\poeml What you've seen with your own eyes, \\
\poeml \v{8}don't be in a hurry to argue in court. \\
\poeml Otherwise, what will you do later on \\
\poemll    when your neighbor humiliates you? \\
\poeml \v{9}Instead, take up the matter with your neighbor, \\
\poemll    and don't betray another person's confidence. \\
\poeml \v{10}Otherwise, anyone who hears will make you ashamed, \\
\poemll    and your bad reputation will never leave you. \\
\poeml \v{11}Like golden apples set in silver \\
\poemll    is a word spoken at the right time. \\
\poeml \v{12}Like a gold earring and a necklace of pure gold \\
\poemll    is a wise reprover to a listening ear. \\
\poeml \v{13}Like cold snow during harvest time \\
\poemll    is a faithful messenger to those who send him; \\
\poemlll       he refreshes his masters. \\
\poeml \v{14}Like clouds and winds without rain \\
\poemll    is the man who brags \\
\poemlll       about gifts he never gave. \\
\poeml \v{15}Through patience a ruler may be persuaded; \\
\poemll    a gentle word\fnote{Lit. \fbib{tongue}} can break a bone. \\
\poeml \v{16}If you find some honey, \\
\poemll    eat only what you need. \\
\poeml Take too much, \\
\poemll    and you'll vomit. \\
\poeml \v{17}Seldom set foot in your neighbor's home; \\
\poemll    otherwise, he'll grow weary and hate you. \\
\poeml \v{18}A club, a sword, and a sharp arrow--- \\
\poemll    that's what a man is who lies about his neighbor. \\
\poeml \v{19}A bad tooth and an unsteady foot--- \\
\poemll    that's what confidence in an unreliable man is like \\
\poemlll       in a time of trouble. \\
\poeml \v{20}Taking your coat off when it's cold \\
\poemll    or pouring vinegar on soda--- \\
\poemlll       that's what singing songs does to a heavy heart. \\
\poeml \v{21}If your enemy hungers, give him food to eat; \\
\poemll    and if he thirsts, give him water to drink. \\
\poeml \v{22}For you'll be piling burning coals of shame\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{of shame}} on his head \\
\poemll    and the \divine{Lord} will reward you. \\
\poeml \v{23}The north wind brings rain, \\
\poemll    and a backbiting tongue an angry look. \\
\poeml \v{24}It's better to live in a corner on the roof \\
\poemll    than in a house with a contentious woman. \\
\poeml \v{25}Cold water to someone who is thirsty\fnote{Or \fbib{tired}}--- \\
\poemll    that's what good news from a distant land is. \\
\poeml \v{26}A muddied spring or a polluted well--- \\
\poemll    that's what a righteous person is \\
\poemlll       who compromises with the wicked. \\
\poeml \v{27}To eat too much honey isn't good; \\
\poemll    and neither is it honorable to seek one's own glory. \\
\poeml \v{28}Like a city with breached walls \\
\poemll    is a man without self-control.

\passage{On Fools}

\begin{poetry}
\poeml \chapt{26}
\v{1}Like snowfall in summer or rain at harvest time, \\

\poemlll       a curse without cause will not alight. \\
\poeml \v{3}A whip is for the horses, \\

\poemll    cuts off his own\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{his own}} feet and drinks violence. \\
\poeml \v{7}Useless legs to the lame--- \\
\poemll    that's what a proverb quoted by a fool is. \\
\poeml \v{8}Tying a stone to a sling--- \\
\poemll    that's what giving honor to a fool is. \\
\poeml \v{9}A thorn in the hand of a drunkard--- \\
\poemll    that's what a proverb quoted by a fool is. \\
\poeml \v{10}An archer who shoots at anyone--- \\
\poemll    is like someone who hires a fool or anyone who passes by. \\
\poeml \v{11}A dog that returns to its vomit \\

\passage{On Laziness}
\poeml \v{13}The lazy person claims, ``There is a lion in the road! \\
\poemll    There's a lion in the streets!'' \\
\poeml \v{14}The door turns on its hinges--- \\
\poemll    as does the lazy person on his bed. \\
\poeml \v{15}The lazy person buries his hand in the dish, \\
\poemll    but he's too tired to bring it to his mouth again. \\
\poeml \v{16}The lazy person is wiser in his own opinion \\
\poemll    than seven men who can give an appropriate response. \\
\poeml \v{17}Picking up a dog by the ears--- \\
\poemll    that's what someone is like who\fnote{Lit. \fbib{who, as he is passing by,}} meddles in another's fight. \\

\passage{On Gossip and Backbiting}
\poeml \v{20}Without wood, the fire goes out. \\
\poemll    Without a gossip, contention stops. \\
\poeml \v{21}Charcoal is to hot coals \\
\poemll    as wood is to fire; \\
\poemlll       so also a quarrelsome man fuels strife. \\
\poeml \v{22}The words of a gossip are like delicate morsels; \\
\poemll    they sink down deep within. \\
\poeml \v{23}A clay vessel plated with a thin veneer of silver--- \\
\poemll    that's what smooth\fnote{So LXX; MT reads \fbib{burning}} lips with a wicked heart are. \\
\poeml \v{24}Someone who hates hides behind his words, \\

\poeml \v{25}Though he speaks graciously, don't believe him, \\

\poeml \v{4}Wrath can be fierce and anger overwhelms \\
\poemll    but who can stand up to jealousy? \\
\poeml \v{5}An open rebuke is better \\

\poeml \v{10}Never abandon your friend nor your father's friend, \\
\poemll    and don't go to your brother's house in times of trouble. \\
\poeml A neighbor who is near is better \\
\poemll    than a brother who lives far away. \\
\poeml \v{11}Be wise, my son, and make me happy, \\
\poemll    so I can reply to anyone who insults me. \\
\poeml \v{12}Those who are prudent see danger and take refuge, \\

\poeml \v{13}Take the coat of anyone who puts up security for a stranger; \\
\poemll    hold it in pledge if he cosigns for an immoral woman. \\
\poeml \v{14}A friend's loud blessing early in the morning \\
\poemll    will be thought of as a curse. \\
\poeml \v{15}A continual dripping on a rainy day \\
\poemll    and a contentious wife are alike. \\
\poeml \v{16}Trying to keep her in check is like stopping a wind storm \\

\poeml \v{20}Sheol\fnote{I.e. the realm of the dead} and Abaddon\fnote{I.e. the realm of destruction in the afterlife} are never satiated, \\
\poemll    and neither are human eyes. \\
\poeml \v{21}As the crucible tests\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{tests}} silver, \\

\poeml \v{23}Keep well informed of the condition of your flocks \\

\poemll    but an undisciplined child\fnote{Lit. \fbib{but a child left alone}} brings shame to his mother. \\
\poeml \v{16}As the wicked grow powerful,\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{powerful}} transgression increases, \\
\poemll    but the righteous will observe their downfall. \\
\poeml \v{17}Correct your son and he will comfort you; \\
\poemll    he will also delight your soul. \\
\poeml \v{18}Without prophetic vision, people abandon restraint, \\
\poemll    but those who obey the Law are happy.
\passage{Dangerous Behaviors}
\poeml \v{19}By mere words a servant will not be corrected; \\
\poemll    even though he understands, \\
\poemlll       there will be no response. \\
\poeml \v{20}Do you see a man who speaks hastily? \\
\poemll    There is more hope for a fool than for him. \\
\poeml \v{21}If you pamper a servant from his childhood, \\
\poemll    later on he'll become ungrateful. \\
\poeml \v{22}An angry man stirs up arguments, \\
\poemll    and a hot-tempered man causes many transgressions. \\
\poeml \v{23}A person's pride will bring about his downfall, \\
\poemll    but the humble in spirit will gain honor. \\
\poeml \v{24}A thief's accomplice hates himself; \\
\poemll    though testifying under oath,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{though he hears the oath}} he reveals nothing. \\
\poeml \v{25}Fearing any human being is a trap, \\
\poemll    but confiding in the \divine{Lord} keeps anyone safe. \\
\poeml \v{26}Many seek a ruler's favor,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{face}} \\
\poemll    but justice for a man comes from the \divine{Lord}. \\
\poeml \v{27}The unjust man is detestable to the righteous, \\
\poemll    and whoever lives blamelessly is detestable to the wicked.

\v{1}A discourse by the faithful collector.\fnote{Or \fbib{by Jakeh's son Agur}}

\begin{poetry}
\poeml This is what this valiant man declared to the God with me, \\
\poemll    to the God with me, who then prevailed:\fnote{Or \fbib{declared to Ithiel, to Ithiel, and Ucal}} \\
\poeml \v{2}Surely I am beyond the senselessness of any man; \\
\poemll    I do not perceive things\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{things}} the way human beings do. \\
\poeml \v{3}I never acquired wisdom, \\
\poemll    but I know what the Holy One knows. \\
\poeml \v{4}Who has ascended to heaven, \\
\poemll    and then descended? \\
\poemlll       Who has collected the wind in his hands? \\
\poeml Who has wrapped up waters in a garment? \\
\poemll    Who has established all the farthest points of the earth? \\
\poeml What is his name, \\
\poemll    and what is his son's name? \\
\poemlll       Surely you know! \\
\poeml \v{5}Everything God says is pure; \\
\poemll    he is a shield for those who take refuge in him. \\
\poeml \v{6}Don't add to his words, \\
\poemll    or he will rebuke you, \\
\poemlll       and you will be shown to be a liar.
\passage{On Contentment in Life}
\poeml \v{7}God,\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{God}} I have asked you for two things--- \\
\poemll    don't refuse me before I die--- \\
\poeml \v{8}Keep deception and lies far away from me, \\
\poemll    and give me neither poverty nor wealth. \\
\poeml Feed me with food that I need for today,\fnote{Or \fbib{that is appropriate for me}} \\
\poeml \v{9}so that I don't become overfed and deny you by saying, \\
\poemlll       ``Who is the \divine{Lord}?'' \\
\poeml or so that I don't become poor and steal, \\
\poemll    and then misuse the name of my God.
\passage{On Different Kinds of People}
\poeml \v{10}Don't lie about a servant to his master, \\
\poemll    or that servant\fnote{Lit. \fbib{or he}} will curse you and you will pay for it. \\
\poeml \v{11}Some people\fnote{Lit. \fbib{A} \fbib{generation}} curse their fathers \\
\poemll    and won't bless their mothers. \\
\poeml \v{12}Some people\fnote{Lit. \fbib{A generation}} view themselves as pure, \\
\poemll    but haven't been cleansed from their own filth. \\
\poeml \v{13}Some people\fnote{Lit. \fbib{A generation}}---what an arrogant look they have!--- \\
\poemll    raise their eyebrows haughtily. \\
\poeml \v{14}Some people\fnote{Lit. \fbib{A generation}} have swords for teeth \\
\poemll    and knives for fangs \\
\poeml to devour the afflicted from the earth \\
\poemll    and the needy from among mankind. \\
\poeml \v{15}The leech has two daughters: \\
\poemll    ``Give'' and ``Give''. \\
\poeml Three things will never be satisfied; \\
\poemll    four will never say ``Enough''--- \\
\poeml \v{16}The afterlife,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Sheol}; i.e. the realm of the dead} the barren womb, \\
\poemll    earth that still demands water, \\
\poemlll       and fire---they never say, ``Enough''. \\
\poeml \v{17}The eye that mocks a father \\
\poemll    and looks with a disobedient attitude at\fnote{Lit. \fbib{and despises obedience to}} a mother--- \\
\poeml the valley ravens will pluck it out; \\
\poemll    and vultures will eat it.
\passage{What Causes Wonder}
\poeml \v{18}Three things cause wonder for me; \\
\poemll    four are beyond my understanding: \\
\poeml \v{19}The way an eagle flies in the sky, \\
\poemll    the way of a serpent on a rock, \\
\poeml the way of a ship on the high seas, \\
\poemll    and the way of a man with a young woman. \\
\poeml \v{20}This is what an immoral woman is like: \\
\poemll    she eats, wipes her mouth, then says \\
\poemlll       ``I've done nothing wrong.'' \\
\poeml \v{21}Under three things the earth trembles, \\
\poemll    under four it cannot remain steady: \\
\poeml \v{22}Under a slave when he becomes a king, \\
\poemll    a fool when he is overfed, \\
\poeml \v{23}an unloved woman when she finds a husband, \\
\poemll    and a servant girl who inherits from her mistress. \\
\poeml \v{24}Four things on earth are small, \\
\poemll    but they are very, very wise: \\
\poeml \v{25}Ants aren't a strong species,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{people}} \\
\poemll    yet they prepare their food in the summer. \\
\poeml \v{26}The rock badgers aren't a strong species\fnote{Lit. \fbib{people}} either, \\
\poemll    yet they build their dens in the rocks. \\
\poeml \v{27}Locusts have no king, \\
\poemll    but they all swarm in ranks. \\
\poeml \v{28}Spiders can be caught by the hand, \\
\poemll    yet they're found in kings' palaces. \\
\poeml \v{29}Three things are stately in procession, \\
\poemll    four which are stately in their gait: \\
\poeml \v{30}The lion, mighty among the beasts, \\
\poemll    retreats before nothing. \\
\poeml \v{31}The strutting rooster, as well as the goat, \\
\poemll    and a king with his army. \\
\poeml \v{32}If you've foolishly exalted yourself \\
\poemll    or if you've plotted evil, \\
\poemlll       put your hand over your mouth. \\
\poeml \v{33}Just as whipping milk produces butter, \\
\poemll    and twisting the nose causes bleeding, \\
\poemlll       so also stirring up anger produces contention.

\poeml \v{3}Never devote all your energy to sex,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{women}} \\
\poemll    or dedicate your life\fnote{Lit. \fbib{ways}} to destroying kings. \\
\poeml \v{4}It is not for kings, Lemuel--- \\
\poemll    Not for kings to drink wine \\
\poemlll       or for rulers to desire liquor. \\
\poeml \v{5}Otherwise, they may drink and forget what has been ordained, \\
\poemll    perverting justice for all the oppressed. \\

\passage{The Honorable Woman}
\poeml \v{10}Who can find a capable wife? \\

\poeml \v{13}She seeks out wool and flax, \\

\poeml \v{15}She rises while it is still night, \\
\poemll    preparing meals for her family \\
\poemlll       and providing for her women servants. \\

\poeml \v{17}She clothes herself with fortitude, \\
\poemll    and fortifies her arms with strength. \\
\poeml \v{18}She is confident that her profits are sufficient. \\
\poemll    Her lamp does not go out at night. \\
\poeml \v{19}She works with her own hands on her clothes\fnote{Lit. \fbib{staff}}--- \\

\poeml \v{20}She reaches out to the poor, \\
\poemll    opening her hands to those in need. \\

\poeml \v{26}She speaks wisely, \\
\poemll    teaching with gracious love. \\
\poeml \v{27}She looks discretely to the affairs of her household, \\
