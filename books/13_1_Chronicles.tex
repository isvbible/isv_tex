\chapt{12}
\v{1}Here's a list of those who came to David at Ziklag when he was unable to travel freely due to Saul son of Kish. They were among the elite soldiers who assisted him in battle. \v{2}Equipped as archers, they could use both their right and left hands to shoot arrows and hurl stones. As descendants of Benjamin, they were Saul's relatives. \v{3}Their leaders were Shemaah's sons Ahiezer and Joash from Gibeah, Azmaveth's sons Jeziel and Pelet, Beracah, Jehu from Anathoth, \v{4}Ishmaiah from Gibeon (who was one of the elite among the Thirty and in charge over them),\fnote{Lit. \fbib{over the Thirty}} Jeremiah,\fnote{The remainder of this v. is 12:5 in MT} Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad from Gederah, \v{5}\fnote{This v. is 12:6 in MT, and so throughout the chapter}Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite, \v{6}Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, Jashobeam, the descendants of Korah, \v{7}and Jeroham's sons Joelah and Zebadiah from Gedor.

\v{8}Mighty and experienced warriors from the descendants of Gad joined David at his wilderness stronghold. They were expert handlers of both shield and spear, with hardened looks\fnote{Lit. \fbib{with faces like those of lions}} and as agile\fnote{Or \fbib{swift}} as a gazelle on a mountain slope. \v{9}Their leader was Ezer, Obadiah was second, Eliab third, \v{10}Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth, \v{11}Attai sixth, Eliel seventh, \v{12}Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth, \v{13}Jeremiah tenth, and Machbannai eleventh. \v{14}These descendants of Gad were army leaders. The least of them\fnote{Lit. \fbib{One of their number}} was equal to a hundred other soldiers\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{other soldiers}} and the greatest to a thousand. \v{15}These men\fnote{Lit. \fbib{These are they who}} crossed the Jordan in the first month of the year\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{of the year}} during flood season and chased out everyone in the valleys, to the east and to the west.

\v{16}Later, some descendants of Benjamin and Judah approached David at his stronghold, \v{17}and David went out to meet them. He told them, ``If you've come in peace to be of help to me, then you'll have my commitment.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{then my heart will be knit to you}} But if you've come to betray me to my enemies, even though I'm innocent of wrongdoing, then may the God of our ancestors watch and judge.''

\v{18}Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, leader of the Thirty, and he said,

So David received them and assigned them to be officers over troops. \v{19}Some of the descendants of Manasseh joined\fnote{Lit. \fbib{fell}} David when he was going to fight against Saul, accompanied by the Philistines. Even so, David was of no help to them, because the Philistine rulers were counseled to send him away. They told themselves, ``He's going to go over to his master Saul at the cost of our heads.''

\v{20}As he traveled toward Ziklag, these descendants of Manasseh joined\fnote{Lit. \fbib{fell}} him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, leaders in charge thousands in Manasseh. \v{21}They helped David against raiders, since they were all warriors and commanders in the army. \v{22}Indeed people kept coming to David every day to help him, until his army became a great, vast army.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{great, like an army of God}}

\v{29}The tribe of\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{The tribe of}; and so throughout the chapter} Benjamin, relatives of Saul numbered 3,000, of whom most had remained allied to what remained of\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{what remained of}} Saul's dynasty.

\v{30}The tribe of Ephraim supplied\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{supplied}; and so throughout the chapter} 20,800 valiant soldiers who were well known in their ancestral households.

\v{31}The half-tribe of Manasseh supplied 18,000, who had been appointed specifically to come and establish David as king.

\v{32}The tribe of Issachar supplied 200 leaders, along with all of their relatives under their command. They kept up-to-date in their understanding of the times and knew what Israel should do.

\v{33}The tribe of Zebulun supplied 50,000 experienced troops, trained in the use of every kind of war weapon, in order to help David\fnote{So LXX. The Heb. lacks \fbib{David}} with undivided loyalty.

\v{34}The tribe of Naphtali supplied 1,000 commanders, accompanied by 37,000 troops armed with shields and spears.

\v{35}The tribe of Dan supplied 28,600 battle-ready troops.

\v{37}The tribes of Reuben and Gad, along with the half-tribe of Manasseh east of\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Manasseh beyond}} the Jordan supplied 120,000 men armed with every kind of war weapon.

\v{38}All these warriors arrived in battle order at Hebron, fully intending to establish David as king over all Israel. Furthermore, all of the rest of Israel were united in their intent to make David king. \v{39}They spent three days eating and drinking with David, since their relatives had supplied provisions for them.

\v{40}Their neighbors came from as far away as the territories of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, bringing provisions loaded on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen.

\v{6}David, accompanied by all of Israel, went up to Baalah (the former name of Kiriath-jearim), which belonged to Judah, to bring from there the Ark of God, the \divine{Lord}, who sits enthroned on the cherubim, and who is called the Name.\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{the}} \v{7}They mounted the Ark of God on a new cart, bringing it from Abinadab's home, with Uzzah and Ahio driving the cart. \v{8}David and all of Israel were dancing in the presence of God with all of their\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{their}} might with songs,\fnote{Cf. 2Sam 6:5, where MT letters of the word \fbib{song} may be transposed as MT word \fbib{cypress}} harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets. \v{9}As they approached Chidon's threshing floor, Uzzah put out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen had stumbled. \v{10}Just then, the anger of the \divine{Lord} blazed against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark, and he died right there in the presence of God.

\v{11}David flew into a rage because the \divine{Lord} had killed\fnote{Or \fbib{had burst out against}} Uzzah. As a result, that place was called Perez-uzzah\fnote{The Heb. name \fbib{Perez-uzzah} means \fbib{Overwhelming Uzzah}; cf. 2Sam 5:20, 6:8} to this day. \v{12}But David feared God that day, and asked ``How am I to bring the Ark of God to me?'' \v{13}As a result, David would not take the ark into the City of David for it to be in his care. Instead, he took it to the home of Obed-edom the Gittite. \v{14}So the Ark of God remained in the care of Obed-edom's household for three months, and God blessed Obed-edom's household, along with everyone associated with it.

So David sent a delegation\fnote{Lit. \fbib{servants}; and so throughout the section} to console him about his loss of his\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{his loss of}} father.

But when David's delegation arrived to visit\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{visit}} Hanun in Ammonite territory to console him, \v{3}the Ammonite officials asked Hanun, ``Do you think that because David has sent a delegation of consolers to you that he is honoring your father? His delegation has arrived to search, overthrow, and scout the land, hasn't it?'' \v{4}So Hanun arrested David's delegation, shaved off their beards, cut off their clothes at the waist line, and sent them away in disgrace.\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{in disgrace}}

\v{5}After they had departed, David was informed about the men, so he sent word\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{word}} to them, since they had been deeply humiliated. He told them, ``Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return.''

\v{6}When the Ammonites realized that they had created quite a stink with David, Hanun and the Ammonites spent 1,000 silver talents\fnote{I.e., about 75,000 pounds; a talent weighed about 75 pounds} to hire chariots and mercenaries from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah, and from Zobah. \v{7}They hired 32,000 chariots, along with the king of Maacah and his army, who arrived and encamped at Medeba. The Ammonites also were mustered and came out to battle from their home cities. \v{8}In response, David sent out Joab and his entire army of elite soldiers. \v{9}The Ammonites went out in battle formation in front of the entrance to the city while the kings who had come stayed by themselves in the open fields.

\v{10}When Joab observed that the battle lines were set up to oppose him both in front and behind, he appointed some special forces from Israel and arrayed them to oppose the Arameans, \v{11}putting the rest of his forces under command of his brother Abishai, who arrayed them to oppose the Ammonites. \v{12}He told Abishai,\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{to Abishai}} ``If the Arameans prove too strong for me, then you are to help me. If the Ammonites prove too strong for you, then I will help you. \v{13}Be strong, be courageous on behalf of our people and for the cities of our God, and may the \divine{Lord} do what he thinks is best.'' \v{14}So Joab and the soldiers who were with him attacked the Arameans in battle formation, and the Arameans retreated in front of him. \v{15}When the Ammonites saw the Arameans retreating, they also retreated from Joab's brother Abishai back to the city and Joab left for Jerusalem. \v{16}After the Arameans realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent for the Arameans who lived beyond the Euphrates River.\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{Euphrates}} Shophach\fnote{Cf. 2Sam 10:16, which reads \fbib{Shobach}} was leading them as commander of Hadadezer's army.

\v{17}When David learned this, he mustered all of Israel, crossed the Jordan, approached the Arameans, and drew up his forces against them. After David had assembled in battle array against the Arameans, the Arameans\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Arameans, they}} attacked him. \v{18}The Arameans retreated from Israel, and David's forces\fnote{Lit. \fbib{David}} killed 7,000 Aramean charioteers, 40,000 soldiers, and Shophach, the commander of their army. \v{19}When Hadadezer's officials saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sought terms of peace with David and became subservient to him.

\v{9}So the \divine{Lord} responded through Gad, David's seer. \v{10}``Go and tell David, `This is what the \divine{Lord} says: ``I'm holding three choices out for you: pick one of them for yourself, and I will do it to you.''\,'\,''\fnote{MT pronouns are sing. in this vs.}

\v{11}Gad went to David and told him, ``This is what the \divine{Lord} says: `Make a choice for yourself: \v{12}Either three years of famine, or three months of reversals\fnote{Or \fbib{destruction}} as you are swept away by your enemies while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or three days with the sword of the \divine{Lord}, consisting of pestilence infecting the land, with the angel of the \divine{Lord} wreaking destruction from border to border throughout all\fnote{Lit. \fbib{destruction in all the border}} of Israel.' Decide right now what I am to answer to the one who sent me.''

\v{13}So David replied to Gad, ``This is a very bad choice for me to make! Let me now please fall into the hand of the \divine{Lord}, because his mercy is very great, but may I never fall into human hands!''

\v{14}Then the \divine{Lord} sent a pestilence to Israel, and 70,000 men died in Israel. \v{15}God also sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem, but as he was about to do so, the \divine{Lord} looked and withdrew\fnote{Or \fbib{and relented concerning}} the calamity by saying to the destroying angel, ``Enough! Stop what you're doing!''\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Stay your hand.}}

So the angel of the \divine{Lord} remained standing near the threshing floor that belonged to Ornan\fnote{Ornan was also known as Araunah; cf. 2Sam 24:16} the Jebusite.\fnote{I.e. a descendant of Canaan's third son (cf. Gen 10:15-16), Jebusites were native to Jebus, the ancient name of the city of Jerusalem} \v{16}David looked up and saw the angel of the \divine{Lord} standing between earth and heaven, with a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.

\v{17}David told God, ``Wasn't I the one who ordered the census of the population? Wasn't it I who sinned and acted wickedly? Now as for these sheep, what have they done? \divine{Lord} God, please let your hand be against me and my ancestral household, but don't let your people be ravaged by plague!''
\passage{David's Altar}
\passageinfo{(2 Samuel 24:18-25)}

\v{18}The angel of the \divine{Lord} told Gad to tell David that David was to go up and build an altar to the \divine{Lord} on the threshing floor that belonged to Ornan the Jebusite. \v{19}So David went up, obeying Gad's directive that he had spoken in the name of the \divine{Lord}. \v{20}Ornan turned around and saw the angel. While his four sons with him ran away to hide, Ornan continued to thresh wheat. \v{21}As David approached Ornan, Ornan looked around and observed David, left the threshing floor, and fell to the ground before David with his face on the ground.

\v{22}David told Ornan, ``Give me the threshing floor as a site to build an altar to the \divine{Lord} on it. Give it to me at its full price, so the plague may be averted from the people.''

\v{23}But Ornan replied to David, ``Take it! Let your majesty the king do whatever seems like a good idea to him. Look here! I'm giving the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing machinery for the wood, and the wheat for a grain offering. I'm giving all of it.''

\v{24}But King David told Ornan, ``No. I will buy them for the full price\fnote{Lit. \fbib{silver}} because I will not offer to the \divine{Lord} what is yours or offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.''

\v{25}So David paid Ornan 600 shekels weight worth in gold for the site, \v{26}built an altar to the \divine{Lord} there, and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called out to the \divine{Lord}, and he answered him from heaven with fire on the altar of burnt offerings. \v{27}After this, the \divine{Lord} spoke to the angel, who then sheathed his sword.

\v{28}From that time on, after David had observed that the \divine{Lord} had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he made his sacrifices there. \v{29}Meanwhile, the tent of the \divine{Lord} that Moses had crafted in the desert, along with the altar of burnt offerings, were being stored at the high place in Gibeon at that time, \v{30}but David was not going before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword carried by the angel of the \divine{Lord}.\chapt{22}
\v{1}David said, ``This is where the \divine{Lord} God's Temple will be, along with the altar of burnt offerings for Israel.''
\labelchapt{22}
\passage{David's Plan to Build the Temple}

\v{2}David subsequently issued orders to conscript the resident aliens who lived in the land of Israel and appointed stonecutters to prepare stones for building a temple for God. \v{3}David also provisioned abundant supplies of iron for nails to build the doors for gates and to build clamps. Furthermore, he provided so much bronze it wasn't inventoried, \v{4}as well as an innumerable amount of cedar logs, since the Sidonians and Tyrians brought vast amounts of cedar to David.

\v{5}David thought, ``My son Solomon is young and inexperienced. The temple that will be built for the \divine{Lord} is to be magnificent, well known, and internationally honored, so I will complete preparations for it.'' So before his death, David finished providing a great quantity of materials for it.
\passage{David Commissions Solomon to Build the Temple}

\v{6}Later, David called for his son Solomon and directed him to build a temple to the \divine{Lord} God of Israel. \v{7}David addressed Solomon: ``I have attempted to build a temple to the name of the \divine{Lord} my God. \v{8}But this message from the \divine{Lord} came to me, telling me

\begin{poetry}
\poeml `You have shed a lot of blood and fought great battles. You won't be building a house for my name, since you have shed so much blood on the earth in my sight. \v{9}But look! A son born to you will live comfortably,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{will be a man of comfort}} because I will give him rest from all his enemies that surround him on every side, since his name will be ``Solomon''---I will give peace and quiet for Israel during his lifetime. \v{10}He will build a temple to my name. He will be a son to me, I myself will be a father to him, and I will secure his royal throne in Israel forever.'
\end{poetry}

\v{11}So now, my son, may the \divine{Lord} be with you, so that you are successful in constructing the Temple of the \divine{Lord} your God, just as he has spoken about you.

\v{12}``Only may the \divine{Lord} give you discretion and understanding as he places you in charge over Israel, so you can keep the Law of the \divine{Lord} your God. \v{13}Then you will be successful, if you keep on observing the statutes and ordinances that the \divine{Lord} commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong, be courageous, and never give in to fear or dismay. \v{14}At great effort I have provided for the Temple of the \divine{Lord} 100,000 gold talents,\fnote{I.e. about 7,500,000 pounds; a talent weighed about 75 pounds} 1,000,000 silver talents,\fnote{I.e. about 75,000,000 pounds; a talent weighed about 75 pounds} as well as bronze and iron beyond calculation, since there is so much of it. I've also provided timber and stone, but you'll need to obtain more. \v{15}You already have plenty of workers, including stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and an innumerable group of artisans who are skilled at working in \v{16}gold, silver, bronze, and iron. So begin the work, and may the \divine{Lord} be with you.''

\v{17}David also issued these orders to all of the leaders of Israel to assist his son Solomon: \v{18}``Isn't the \divine{Lord} your God with you? Hasn't he surrounded you with comfort? He has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my control, and the land lies subdued both in the \divine{Lord}'s presence and before his people. \v{19}So set your minds and hearts to seek the \divine{Lord} your God, to get up, and to build the sanctuary of the \divine{Lord} God, so the Ark of the Covenant of the \divine{Lord} and the holy vessels of God may be stored in a temple built for the name of the \divine{Lord}.''

\passage{The Levitical Divisions}

\chapt{23}
\v{1}After David had reached old age, and had completed his reign,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{days}} he set his son Solomon as king over Israel. \v{2}David then gathered together all of the leaders of Israel, including the priests and descendants of Levi. \v{3}descendants of Levi 30 years old and above were counted for a total of 38,000. \v{4}``24,000 of these,'' David said, ``are to be set in charge of the work of the Temple of the \divine{Lord}, with 6,000 serving as officers and judges, \v{5}with 4,000 gatekeepers, and with 4,000 offering praises to the \divine{Lord} with the musical instruments that I have had crafted.''

\v{6}David divided them into divisions based on Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, Levi's sons.
\passage{An Abbreviated Genealogy of Levi's Sons}

\v{7}The descendants of Gershon were Ladan and Shimei. \v{8}The three descendants of Ladan included\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{included}; and so throughout the chapter.} Jehiel (their chief), Zetham, and Joel. \v{9}The three descendants of Shimei included Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran. These were the heads of families of Ladan.

\v{10}The descendants of Shimei included Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were sons of Shimei. \v{11}Jahath served as chief and Zizah was second in rank, but since Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, they were enrolled as a single family unit.

\v{12}The four descendants of Kohath included Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. \v{13}The descendants of Amram included Aaron and Moses. Aaron had been set apart to consecrate the most holy things, with the intent that he and his sons should present offerings in the \divine{Lord}'s presence forever, ministering to him and pronouncing blessings in his name forever.

\v{14}Meanwhile, as for Moses the man of God, his sons were considered among the tribe of Levi. \v{15}The descendants of Moses included Gershom and Eliezer. \v{16}The descendants of Gershom included Shebuel as their chief.

\v{17}The descendants of Eliezer included Rehabiah as their chief. Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had many descendants.

\v{18}The descendants of Izhar included Shelomith their chief.

\v{19}The descendants of Hebron included Jeriah their chief, Amariah their second in rank, Jahaziel their third, and Jekameam their fourth.

\v{20}The descendants of Uzziel included Micah their chief and Isshiah their second in rank.

\v{21}The descendants of Merari included Mahli and Mushi. The descendants of Mahli included Eleazar and Kish, \v{22}but Eleazar died having no sons, but only daughters. Their relatives (the descendants of Kish) married them. \v{23}The three descendants of Mushi included Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.

\v{24}These were the descendants of Levi according to their ancestral households, with family heads documented according to the names of persons 20 years and older who were appointed to perform work in service to the Temple of the \divine{Lord}.

\v{25}For David had said ``The \divine{Lord} God of Israel has granted rest to his people, and he has taken Israel as his eternal residence. \v{26}Therefore\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Also}} the descendants of Levi are no longer to carry the Tent or its service implements.''\fnote{The quotation possibly concludes at the end of vs. 25.} \v{27}Since, according to David's final instructions, the list above\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{above}} contains the total number of descendants of Levi from the age of 20 years and upward, \v{28}David issued these orders:\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{David issued these orders}}

\begin{poetry}
\poeml ``Instead, they are to assist by lending a hand to the descendants of Aaron regarding service to the Temple of the \divine{Lord} relating to the courts, the chambers, purification of everything pertaining to holiness, and to anything else pertaining to service on behalf of the Temple of God, \v{29}including assisting with the rows of showbread, selecting flour for the grain offerings, the unleavened bread, baked offerings, and oil-based offerings, no matter what the quantity or sizes. \v{30}They are to take their stand morning by morning, thanking and praising the \divine{Lord} right through until the evening, \v{31}whenever burnt offerings are presented to the \divine{Lord}, whether on Sabbaths, New Moons, or scheduled festivals, regularly in the \divine{Lord}'s presence in accordance with the number required to conduct their service. \v{32}By doing this, they will fulfill their obligation as trustees over the Tent of Assembly and the Sanctuary, attending to the needs of\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{to the needs of}} their relatives, who are descendants of Aaron, in keeping with their service on behalf of the Temple of the \divine{Lord}.''
\end{poetry}
\labelchapt{24}
\passage{The Priestly Divisions}

\chapt{24}
\v{1}With respect to the descendants of Aaron, classes of service were organized for Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, the descendants of Aaron. \v{2}But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, leaving no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar became priests. \v{3}Along with Zadok, one of Eleazar's descendants, and Ahimelech, one of Ithamar's descendants, David organized their service according to their assigned responsibilities.

\v{4}More leaders were located among Eleazar's descendants than among those of Ithamar, so sixteen leaders were appointed from the leaders of the ancestral households of Eleazar's descendants and eight from those of Ithamar. \v{5}They were chosen by impartial lottery, since there were trustees\fnote{Lit. \fbib{officers}} of the sanctuary and officers of God among both Eleazar's descendants and among Ithamar's descendants. \v{6}Nethanel's son Shemaiah, a Levitical scribe, made an official record of them for the king, the officers, Zadok the priest, Abiathar's son Ahimelech, and the heads of ancestral households of both the priests and the descendants of Levi. One ancestral house was chosen for Eleazar and one for Ithamar.

\v{7}The first lottery was chosen in favor of Jehoiarib, the second for Jedaiah, \v{8}third for Harim, the fourth for Seorim, \v{9}the fifth for Malchijah, the sixth for Mijamin, \v{10}the seventh for Hakkoz, the eighth for Abijah, \v{11}the ninth for Jeshua, the tenth for Shecaniah, \v{12}the eleventh for Eliashib, the twelfth for Jakim, \v{13}the thirteenth for Huppah, the fourteenth for Jeshebeab, \v{14}the fifteenth for Bilgah, the sixteenth for Immer, \v{15}the seventeenth for Hezir, the eighteenth for Happizzez, \v{16}the nineteenth for Pethahiah, the twentieth for Jehezkel, \v{17}the twenty-first for Jachin, the twenty-second for Gamul, \v{18}the twenty-third for Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth for Maaziah. \v{19}These were appointed to enter the Temple of the \divine{Lord} according to their protocols established by their ancestor Aaron, as commanded by the \divine{Lord} God of Israel.
\passage{Other Levitical Divisions}

\v{20}Now with respect to the descendants of Levi there remained Shubael from the descendants of Amram and Jehdeiah from the descendants of Shubael; \v{21}with respect to Rehabiah, Isshiah their chief from the descendants Rehabiah; \v{22}with respect to the Izharites, Shelomoth, Jahath from the descendants of Shelomoth; \v{23}with respect to the descendants of Hebron, Jeriah their chief, Amariah their second in rank, Jahaziel their third, and Jekameam their fourth; \v{24}with respect to the descendants of Uzziel, Micah; with respect to the descendants of Micah, Shamir; \v{25}with respect to Micah's brother Isshiah; with respect to the descendants of Isshiah, Zechariah; \v{26}with respect to Merari's sons, Mahli and Mushi; with respect to the sons of Jaaziah, Beno; \v{27}with respect to the sons of Merari, Jaaziah, Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri; \v{28}with respect to Mahli, Eleazar, who had no sons; \v{29}with respect to Kish, Jerahmeel, one of the descendants of Kish; \v{30}and with respect to the descendants of Mushi, Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the descendants of Levi according to their ancestral households. \v{31}These individuals also cast lots corresponding to their relatives, Aaron's descendants, in the presence of King David, Zadok, and Ahimelech, and in the presence of the heads of the ancestral households of the priests and of the descendants of Levi, and the eldest was treated as impartially as was the younger brother.

\passage{The Musicians}

\chapt{25}
\v{1}Along with officers in his army, David consecrated to assist in service to the descendants of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun those who prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals.

The list of those who participated in this service included: \v{2}from the descendants of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, sons of Asaph mentored by\fnote{Lit. \fbib{under the hand of}; and so throughout the chapter} Asaph himself, who prophesied under the supervision\fnote{Lit. \fbib{hand}} of the king; \v{3}from Jeduthun, these six of his descendants: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, mentored by their father Jeduthun, who played a lyre and prophesied, giving thanks and praise to the \divine{Lord}; \v{4}from Heman, these descendants: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth. \v{5}All of these were descendants of Heman the king's seer, according to God's promise to exalt him, since God had given Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. \v{6}They were all under their father's supervision regarding music in the Temple of the \divine{Lord} with cymbals, harps, and lyres for the service of the Temple of God.

Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under command of the king. \v{7}They and their relatives who had been skillfully trained in singing to the \divine{Lord}, numbered 288. \v{8}Their duties, whether significant or insignificant, whether performed by teacher or pupil alike, were assigned by lottery.

\v{9}Asaph's first lottery was cast in favor of Joseph; the second went to Gedaliah, that is, to him, to his relatives, and his sons, for a total of twelve;\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{for a total of}; and so throughout the chapter} \v{10}the third to Zaccur, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{11}the fourth to Izri, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{12}the fifth to Nethaniah, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{13}the sixth to Bukkiah, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{14}the seventh to Jesharelah, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{15}the eighth to Jeshaiah, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{16}the ninth to Mattaniah, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{17}the tenth to Shimei, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{18}the eleventh to Azarel, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{19}the twelfth to Hashabiah, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{20}the thirteenth to Shubael, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{21}the fourteenth to Mattithiah, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{22}the fifteenth to Jeremoth, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{23}the sixteenth to Hananiah, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{24}the seventeenth to Joshbekashah, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{25}the eighteenth to Hanani, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{26}the nineteenth to Mallothi, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{27}the twentieth to Eliathah, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{28}the twenty-first to Hothir, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{29}the twenty-second to Giddalti, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{30}the twenty-third to Mahazioth, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve; \v{31}the twenty-fourth to Romamti-ezer, his sons and his relatives, for a total of twelve.

\passage{David Addresses Israel}

\chapt{28}
\v{1}David gathered together all of the leaders of Israel, the leaders of the tribes, division officers who reported to the king, the commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, the supervisors of the property and livestock that belonged to the king and to his sons, along with all of the officers of the palace, the elite forces, and all of the soldiers.

\v{2}King David rose to his feet and said, ``My fellow citizens,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{My brothers and my people}} may I have your attention. I intended to build a house of rest for the Ark of the Covenant of the \divine{Lord}, for a footstool of our God, so I began preparations for its construction. \v{3}But then God told me, `You will not build a temple to my name, because you are a man of war, and you have committed bloodshed.'\fnote{I.e. perhaps an allusion to Uriah the Hittite} \v{4}Nevertheless, the \divine{Lord} God of Israel chose me from my entire ancestral household to be king over Israel forever, since he had chosen Judah as Commander-in-Chief.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Nagid}; i.e. a senior officer entrusted with dual roles of operational oversight and administrative authority} In my ancestor Judah's household, from my father's household, and from among my father's sons it pleased him to make me king over all of Israel.

\v{5}``Now out of all of my sons (since the \divine{Lord} has given me many of them), he has selected my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the \divine{Lord}, ruling\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{ruling}} over Israel. \v{6}He told me,

\begin{poetry}
\poeml `I chose your son Solomon to be the one who will construct my Temple and my courts, because I have chosen him to be a son to me, and I will be a father to him. \v{7}I will establish his kingdom forever, assuming he remains strongly committed to carry out my commandments and ordinances, as he is doing today.'
\end{poetry}

\v{8}Therefore, in the presence\fnote{Lit. \fbib{eyes}} of all of Israel, the assembly of the \divine{Lord}, and while our God is listening, observe and search through all of the commandments of the \divine{Lord} your God, so that you may continue to possess this good land, leaving it for an inheritance forever to benefit your descendants who come after you.''
\passage{David Addresses Solomon Directly}

\v{9}``Now as for you, my son Solomon, get to know the God of your father. Serve him with a sound heart and a devoted soul, because the \divine{Lord} is searching every heart, every plan and thought. He will be found by you, assuming you are seeking him, but if you abandon him, he will abandon you forever. \v{10}So keep watching, because the \divine{Lord} has chosen you to build the Temple of his sanctuary. So be strong, and get to work!''

\passage{David Continues His Address}

\v{19}``All of these things the \divine{Lord} made clear to me in writing at his direction---the construction plans for all of the building.''

\v{20}David continued with these words for his son Solomon: ``Be strong and courageous, and get to work. Never be afraid or discouraged, for the \divine{Lord} God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you nor will he abandon you right up to your completion of the work for the service of the Temple of the \divine{Lord}. \v{21}Now look! Here are the ranks of the priests and the descendants of Levi for the entire service of the Temple of God, and in all of the work there will be all types of volunteers who have skills for anything needed for the services. Furthermore, the officers and all of the people will be at your complete command.''

\passage{Offerings for the Temple}

\chapt{29}
\v{1}Then King David addressed the entire assembly: ``My son Solomon, the one whom God alone has chosen, is still young and inexperienced, and the task is great, since this structure will be a citadel to the \divine{Lord} God and not for human beings. \v{2}To the extent that I have been able to do so, I have provided supplies for the Temple of my God, including gold for what is to be made of gold, silver for what is to be made of silver, bronze for what is to be made of bronze, iron for what is to be made of iron, wood for what is to be made of wood, and great quantities of onyx, precious stones, antimony, colored stones, all types of other semi-precious stones, and plenty of marble.

\v{3}``In addition to everything that I have supplied for the Temple, it pleases me to provide my own treasure of gold and silver, so because of my love for the Temple of my God I hereby give to the Temple of my God the following: \v{4}3,000 gold talents\fnote{I.e. about 225,000 pounds; a talent weighed about 75 pounds} imported from Ophir,\fnote{Or \fbib{from a source of fine gold}; cf. 2Chr 8:18} 7,000 talents\fnote{I.e. about 525,000 pounds; a talent weighed about 75 pounds} of refined silver for gilding the walls of the Temple \v{5}and for all the work to be undertaken by skilled artists, gold for what is to be made of gold, and silver for what is to be made of silver. Who then, will be dedicating the productivity\fnote{Lit. \fbib{filling}} of his own work\fnote{Lit. \fbib{hand}} to the \divine{Lord} today?''

\v{6}So the leaders of the ancestral households presented their voluntary offerings, as did the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king's business. \v{7}They presented 5,000 gold talents\fnote{I.e. about 375,000 pounds; a talent weighed about 75 pounds} and 10,000 gold darics\fnote{I.e. about 156 pounds; a daric weighed about one quarter of an ounce} for the work of the Temple of God, 10,000 silver talents\fnote{I.e. about 750,000 pounds; a talent weighed about 75 pounds}, 18,000 bronze talents,\fnote{I.e. about 1,350,000 pounds; a talent weighed about 75 pounds} and 100,000 iron talents.\fnote{I.e. about 7,500,000 pounds; a talent weighed about 75 pounds} \v{8}Whoever owned precious stones gave them to the treasury of the Temple of the \divine{Lord}, in care of Jehiel the Gershonite. \v{9}Then the people rejoiced because they had given voluntarily, since with a devoted heart they had freely given to the \divine{Lord}.
\passage{David's Praise to God}

King David also rejoiced greatly. \v{10}Then David blessed the \divine{Lord} in the presence of the entire assembly. David said,

\begin{poetry}

\poemlll       that we make such voluntary offerings as these? \\
\poeml For all things come from you, \\

\poeml \v{16}\divine{Lord} our God, all of this abundance that we have given \\

\v{20}Then David told the entire assembly, ``Bless the \divine{Lord} your God, please.'' So the entire assembly blessed the \divine{Lord} God of their ancestors, bowing their heads and falling in the \divine{Lord}'s presence and before the king. \v{21}The next day, they offered sacrifices and burnt offerings to the \divine{Lord} amounting to\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{amounting to}} 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs, along with their libations.
