\poeml Under the apple tree\fnote{Or \fbib{apricot tree}} I awakened you. \\
\poemll    There your mother had gone into labor with you; \\
\poemlll       there she went into labor and gave birth to you. \\
\poeml \v{6}Set me like a seal\fnote{I.e. a cylinder seal or a signet ring used to indicate ownership or authority} over your heart, \\
\poemll    like a seal on your arm. \\
\poeml For love is as strong as death, \\
\poemll    passion\fnote{Or \fbib{jealousy}} as intense as Sheol.\fnote{I.e. the realm of the dead} \\
\poeml The flames of love\fnote{Lit. \fbib{its flames}} are flames of fire, \\
\poemll    a blaze that comes from the \divine{Lord}.\fnote{Or \fbib{an intense blaze}} \\
\poeml \v{7}Mighty bodies of water cannot extinguish love, \\
\poemll    rivers cannot put it out. \\
\poeml If a man were to give all the wealth of his house for love, \\
\poemll    he would surely be viewed with contempt.
\passage{The Loved One's Brothers}
\poeml \v{8}We\fnote{I.e. the bride's brothers} have a little sister, \\
\poemll    and she has not yet reached maturity.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{has no breasts}} \\
\poeml What will we do for our sister \\
\poemll    to prepare her for\fnote{Lit. \fbib{sister on the day when she's spoken for}} her engagement?\fnote{Or \fbib{marriage}} \\
\poeml \v{9}If she's a wall, \\
\poemll    on her we will build a battlement of silver. \\
\poeml If she's a door, \\
\poemll    we will enclose her with planks of cedar.
\passage{The Loved One}
\poeml \v{10}I was a wall and my breasts were like towers. \\
\poemll    Then I became like one who finds peace\fnote{Or \fbib{contentment}} in his eyes. \\
\poeml \v{11}Solomon has a vineyard in Baal-hamon. \\
\poemll    He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers--- \\
\poeml each one is to bring 1,000 pieces of silver \\
\poemll    in exchange for its fruit. \\
\poeml \v{12}My vineyard belongs to me and is at my disposal.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{is before me}} \\
\poemll    The 1,000 are for you, Solomon, \\
\poemlll       and 200 are for those who take care of its fruit.
\passage{The Lover}
\poeml \v{13}You who sit in the gardens, \\
\poemll    companions are listening for your voice, \\
\poemlll       but let me hear it.
\passage{The Loved One}
\poeml \v{14}Come quickly, my beloved, and be like a gazelle \\
\poemll    or a young stag on the mountains of spices.\end{poetry}
