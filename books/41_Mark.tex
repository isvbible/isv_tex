\passageinfo{(Matthew 3:1-12; Luke 3:1-9, 15-17; John 1:19-28)}

\chapt{1}
\v{1}This is\fnote{The Gk. lacks \fbib{This is}} the beginning of the gospel of Jesus the Messiah,\fnote{Or \fbib{Christ}} the Son of God.\fnote{Other mss. lack \fbib{the Son of God}} \v{2}As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,

\begin{poetry}
\poeml ``See! I am sending my messenger ahead of you, \\
\poemll    who will prepare your way.\fnote{Cf. Mal 3:1} \\
\poeml \v{3}He is a voice calling out in the wilderness: \\

\poemlll       Make his paths straight!'\,''\fnote{Cf. Isa 40:3}
\end{poetry}

\v{4}John was baptizing in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism about repentance for the forgiveness of sins. \v{5}People from\fnote{The Gk. lacks \fbib{People from}} the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were flocking to him, being baptized by him while they confessed their sins. \v{6}Now John was dressed in camel's hair with\fnote{Lit. \fbib{and}} a leather belt around his waist. He ate grasshoppers\fnote{Or \fbib{locust-shaped carob seed pods}} and wild honey. \v{7}He kept proclaiming, ``The one who is coming after me is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to bend down and untie his sandal straps. \v{8}I baptized you with\fnote{Or \fbib{in}} water, but it is he who will baptize you with\fnote{Or \fbib{in}} the Holy Spirit.''
\passage{Jesus is Baptized}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 3:13-17; Luke 3:21-22)}

\v{9}In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. \v{10}Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. \v{11}Then a voice came from heaven: ``You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you!''
\passage{Jesus is Tempted by Satan}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 4:1-11; Luke 4:1-13)}

\passage{Jesus Begins His Ministry in Galilee}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 4:12-17; Luke 4:14-15)}

\v{14}Now after John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee and proclaimed the gospel about the kingdom\fnote{Other mss. lack \fbib{about the kingdom}} of God. \v{15}He said, \red{``The time is now! The kingdom of God is near! Repent, and keep believing the gospel!''}
\passage{Jesus Calls His First Disciples}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 4:18-22; Luke 5:1-11)}

\v{16}While Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen. \v{17}Jesus told them, \red{``Follow me, and I'll make you fishers of people!''} \v{18}So immediately they left their nets and followed him. \v{19}Going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat repairing their nets. \v{20}He immediately called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.
\passage{Jesus Heals a Man with an Unclean Spirit}
\passageinfo{(Luke 4:31-37)}

\v{21}Then they went to Capernaum. As soon as it was the Sabbaths, Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} went into the synagogue and began to teach. \v{22}The people\fnote{Lit. \fbib{They}} were utterly amazed at his teaching, because he was teaching them like one with authority, and not like their scribes. \v{23}All of a sudden,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Immediately}} there was a man in their synagogue who had an unclean spirit! He screamed, \v{24}``What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are---the Holy One of God!''

\v{25}But Jesus rebuked him. \red{``Be quiet,''} he ordered, \red{``and come out of him!''} \v{26}At this, the unclean spirit shook the man,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} cried out with a loud voice, and came out of him.

\v{27}All the people were so stunned that they kept saying to each other, ``What is this? A new teaching with authority! He tells even the unclean spirits what to do, and they obey him!'' \v{28}At once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.
\passage{Jesus Heals Many People}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 8:14-17; Luke 4:38-41)}

\v{29}After they left the synagogue, they went directly to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John. \v{30}Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed, sick with a fever, so they promptly told Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} about her. \v{31}He went up to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began serving them. \v{32}When evening came, after the sun had set, people\fnote{Lit. \fbib{they}} started bringing to him everyone who was sick or possessed by demons. \v{33}In fact, the whole city gathered at the door. \v{34}He healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. However, he wouldn't allow the demons to speak because they knew who he was.
\passage{Jesus Goes on a Preaching Tour}
\passageinfo{(Luke 4:42-44)}

\v{35}In the morning, while it was still very dark, Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} got up and went to a deserted place and prayed there. \v{36}Simon and his companions searched frantically for him. \v{37}When they found him, they told him, ``Everyone's looking for you.''

\v{38}\red{``Let's go to the neighboring town,''} he replied, \red{``so I can preach there, too, because that's why I came.''} \v{39}So he went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.
\passage{Jesus Cleanses a Leper}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 8:1-4; Luke 5:12-16)}

\v{40}Then a leper\fnote{I.e. a man with a serious skin disease} came to Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} and began pleading with him. He fell on his knees and told him, ``If you want to, you can make me clean.''

\v{41}Moved with compassion, Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} reached out his hand, touched him, and told him, \red{``I do want to. Be made clean!''} \v{42}Instantly the leprosy left him, and he was clean.

\v{43}Then Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} sternly warned him and encouraged him to go at once. \v{44}He told the man, \red{``Be sure that you don't tell anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest, and then offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded as proof to the authorities.''}\fnote{Lit. \fbib{to them}} \v{45}But when the man\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} left, he began to proclaim it freely. He spread the news so widely that Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} could no longer enter a town openly, but had to stay out in deserted places. Still, people\fnote{Lit. \fbib{they}} kept coming to him from everywhere.

\passage{Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 9:1-8; Luke 5:17-26)}

\chapt{2}
\v{1}Several days later, Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} returned to Capernaum and it was reported that he was at home. \v{2}Such a large crowd gathered that there wasn't room for them, even in front of the door. Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{He}} was speaking his message to them \v{3}when some people\fnote{Lit. \fbib{they}} came and brought him a paralyzed man being carried by four men. \v{4}Since they couldn't bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof over the place where he was. They dug through it and let down the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.

\v{5}When Jesus saw their faith, he told the paralyzed man, \red{``Son, your sins are forgiven.''}

\v{6}Now some scribes were sitting there, arguing among themselves,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{in their hearts}} \v{7}``Why does this man talk this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?''

\v{8}At once, Jesus knew in his spirit what they were saying to themselves. \red{``Why are you arguing about such things among yourselves?''}\fnote{Lit. \fbib{in your hearts}} he asked them. \v{9}\red{``Which is easier: to say to the paralyzed man, `Your sins are forgiven,' or `Get up, pick up your mat, and walk'?} \v{10}\red{But I want you to know\fnote{Lit. \fbib{So that you will know}} that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins{\ldots}''} Then he told the paralyzed man, \v{11}\red{``I say to you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home!''} \v{12}So the man\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} got up, immediately picked up his mat, and went out in front of all of them.

As a result, all of the people were amazed and began to glorify God as they kept on saying, ``We have never seen anything like this!''
\passage{Jesus Calls Matthew}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 9:9-13; Luke 5:27-32)}

\v{13}Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{He}} went out again beside the sea. The whole crowd kept coming to him, and he kept teaching them. \v{14}As he was walking along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's desk. Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{He}} told him, \red{``Follow me!''} So Levi\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} got up and followed him.

\v{15}Later, he was having dinner at Levi's\fnote{Lit. \fbib{his}} house. Many tax collectors and sinners were also eating with Jesus and his disciples, because there were many who were following him. \v{16}When the scribes and the Pharisees saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, ``Why does he eat and drink\fnote{Other mss. lack \fbib{and drink}} with tax collectors and sinners?''

\v{17}When Jesus heard that, he told them, \red{``Healthy people don't need a physician, but sick ones do. I did not come to call righteous people, but sinners.''}
\passage{A Question about Fasting}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 9:14-17; Luke 5:33-39)}

\v{18}Now John's disciples and the Pharisees would fast regularly. Some people\fnote{Lit. \fbib{They}} came and asked Jesus,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} ``Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast, but your disciples don't fast?''

\v{19}Jesus replied, \red{``The wedding guests\fnote{Lit. \fbib{The children of the wedding hall}; or \fbib{The children of the groom}} can't fast while the groom is with them, can they? As long as they have the groom with them, they can't fast.} \v{20}\red{But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day.''}
\passage{The Unshrunk Cloth}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 9:16; Luke 5:36)}

\v{21}\red{``No one patches an old garment with a piece of unshrunk cloth. If he does, the patch pulls away from it---the new from the old---and a worse tear is made.} \v{22}\red{And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will make the skins burst, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is poured\fnote{The Gk. lacks \fbib{is poured}} into fresh wineskins.''}
\passage{Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 12:1-8; Luke 6:1-5)}

\v{23}Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{He}} happened to be going through the grain fields on a Sabbath.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{on the Sabbaths}} As they made their way, his disciples began picking the heads of grain. \v{24}The Pharisees asked him, ``Look! Why are they doing what is not lawful on Sabbath days?''\fnote{Lit. \fbib{on the Sabbaths}}

\v{25}He asked them, \red{``Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?} \v{26}\red{How was it that he went into the House of God during the lifetime\fnote{The Gk. lacks \fbib{the lifetime}} of Abiathar the high priest and ate the Bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat, and gave some of it to his companions?''}

\v{27}Then he told them, \red{``The Sabbath was made for people, not people for the Sabbath.} \v{28}\red{Therefore, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.''}
\labelchapt{3}
\passage{Jesus Heals a Man with a Paralyzed Hand}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 12:9-14; Luke 6:6-11)}

\chapt{3}
\v{1}Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{He}} went into the synagogue again, and a man with a paralyzed hand was there. \v{2}The people\fnote{Lit. \fbib{They}} watched Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} closely to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Sabbaths}} intending to accuse him of doing something wrong. \v{3}He told the man with the paralyzed hand, \red{``Come forward.''}\fnote{Lit. \fbib{into the middle}} \v{4}Then he asked them, \red{``Is it lawful to do good or to do evil on Sabbath days,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{on the Sabbaths}} to save a life or to destroy it?''} But they remained silent.

\v{5}Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{He}} looked around at them in anger, deeply hurt because of their hard hearts. Then he told the man, \red{``Hold out your hand.''} The man\fnote{Lit. \fbib{He}} held it out, and his hand was restored to health. \v{6}Immediately the Pharisees and Herodians\fnote{I.e. Royal party sympathizers} went out and began to plot how to kill him.
\passage{Jesus Encounters a Large Crowd}

\v{7}So Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea. A large crowd from Galilee, Judea, \v{8}Jerusalem, Idumea, from across the Jordan, and from the region around Tyre and Sidon followed him. They came to him because they kept hearing about everything he was doing. \v{9}Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{He}} told his disciples to have a boat ready for him so that the crowd wouldn't crush him, \v{10}because he had healed so many people that everyone who had diseases kept crowding up against him in order to touch him. \v{11}Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they would fall down in front of him and scream, ``You are the Son of God!'' \v{12}But he sternly ordered them again and again not to tell people who he was.
\passage{Jesus Appoints Twelve Apostles}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 10:1-4; Luke 6:12-16)}

\v{13}Then Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} went up on a hillside and called to himself those whom he had decided on, and they approached him. \v{14}He appointed the Twelve,\fnote{Or \fbib{appointed twelve}} whom he called apostles, to accompany him, to be sent out to preach, \v{15}and to have the authority to drive out demons. \v{16}He appointed the Twelve:\fnote{Other mss. lack \fbib{He appointed the Twelve}} Simon (whom he named Peter), \v{17}Zebedee's sons James and his brother John (whom he named Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder), \v{18}Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus,\fnote{Other mss. read \fbib{Lebbaeus}} Simon the Cananaean,\fnote{\fbib{Cananaean} is Aram. for \fbib{Zealot.}} \v{19}and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
\passage{Jesus is Accused of Working with Beelzebul}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 12:22-32; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)}

\v{20}Then he went home. Such a large crowd gathered again that Jesus and his disciples\fnote{Lit. \fbib{so that they}} couldn't even eat. \v{21}When his family heard about it, they went to restrain him, because they kept saying, ``He's out of his mind!''

\v{22}The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem kept repeating, ``He has Beelzebul,'' and, ``He drives out demons by the ruler of demons.''

\v{23}So Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} called them together and began to speak to them in parables. \red{``How can Satan drive out Satan?} \v{24}\red{If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.} \v{25}\red{And if a household is divided against itself, that household won't stand.} \v{26}\red{So if Satan rebels against himself and is divided, he cannot stand. Indeed, his end has come.} \v{27}\red{No one can go into a strong man's house and carry off his possessions without first tying up the strong man. Then he can ransack his house.} \v{28}\red{I tell all of you\fnote{The Gk. pronoun \fbib{you} is pl.} with certainty, people will be forgiven their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter.}\fnote{Lit. \fbib{they blaspheme}} \v{29}\red{But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven, but is guilty of eternal sin.''} \v{30}{\ldots}because they had been saying, ``He has an unclean spirit.''
\passage{The True Family of Jesus}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 12:46-50; Luke 8:19-21)}

\v{31}Then his mother and his brothers arrived. Milling around outside, they sent for him, continuously summoning him. \v{32}A crowd was sitting around him. They told him, ``Look! Your mother and your brothers\fnote{Other mss. read \fbib{your brothers and sisters}} are outside asking for you.''

\v{33}He answered them, \red{``Who are my mother and my brothers?''} \v{34}Then looking at the people sitting around him, he said, \red{``Here are my mother and my brothers!} \v{35}\red{Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.''}
\labelchapt{4}
\passage{The Parable about a Farmer}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 13:1-9; Luke 8:4-18)}

\chapt{4}
\v{1}Then Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} began to teach again beside the sea. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{on the sea}} while the entire crowd remained beside the sea on the shore. \v{2}He began teaching them many things in parables. While he was teaching them he said, \v{3}\red{``Listen! A farmer went out to sow.} \v{4}\red{As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, and birds came and ate them up.} \v{5}\red{Others fell on stony ground, where they didn't have a lot of soil. They sprouted at once, because the soil wasn't deep.} \v{6}\red{But when the sun came up, they were scorched. Since they didn't have any roots, they dried up.} \v{7}\red{Others fell among thorn bushes, and the thorn bushes came up and choked them out, and they didn't produce anything.} \v{8}\red{But others fell on good soil and produced a crop. They grew up, increased in size, and produced 30, 60, or 100 times what was sown.''}\fnote{The Gk. lacks \fbib{what was sown}} \v{9}He added, \red{``Let the person who has ears to hear, listen!''}
\passage{The Purpose of the Parables}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 13:10-17; Luke 8:9-10)}

\v{10}When he was alone with the Twelve and those around him, they began to ask him about the parables. \v{11}He told them, \red{``The secret about the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside, everything comes in parables} \v{12}\red{so that}

\begin{poetry}

\end{poetry}
\passage{Jesus Explains the Parable about the Farmer}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 13:18-23; Luke 8:11-15)}

\v{13}Then he told them, \red{``You don't understand this parable, so how can you understand any of the parables?} \v{14}\red{The farmer sows the word.} \v{15}\red{Some people are like the seeds\fnote{Lit. \fbib{These are the ones}} along the path, where the word is sown. When they hear it, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.} \v{16}\red{Others are like the seeds\fnote{Lit. \fbib{These are the ones}} sown on the stony ground. When they hear the word, at once they joyfully accept it,} \v{17}\red{but since they don't have any roots, they last for only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes along because of the word, they immediately fall away.} \v{18}\red{Still others are like the seeds\fnote{Lit. \fbib{are those}} sown among the thorn bushes. These are the people who hear the word,} \v{19}\red{but the worries of life, the deceitful pleasures of wealth, and the desires for other things come in and choke the word so that it can't produce a crop.} \v{20}\red{Others are like the seeds\fnote{Lit. \fbib{are those}} sown on good soil.

\passage{A Light under a Basket}
\passageinfo{(Luke 8:16-18)}

\v{21}Then Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} told them, \red{``A lamp isn't brought indoors to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? It's to be put on a lamp stand, isn't it?} \v{22}\red{Nothing is hidden except for the purpose of having it revealed, and nothing is secret except for the purpose of having it come to light.} \v{23}\red{If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen!}

\v{24}He went on to say to them, \red{``Pay attention to what you're hearing! You will be evaluated by the same standard with which you do your evaluating, and still more will be given to you,} \v{25}\red{because whoever has something, will have more given to him.

\passage{The Parable about a Growing Seed}

\v{26}He was also saying, \red{``The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seeds on the ground.} \v{27}\red{He sleeps and gets up night and day while the seeds sprout and grow, although he doesn't know how} \v{28}\red{the ground produces grain by itself---first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head.} \v{29}\red{But when the grain is ripe, he immediately starts cutting with his sickle because the harvest time has come.''}
\passage{The Parable about a Mustard Seed}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 13:31-32; Luke 13:18-19)}

\v{30}He was also saying, \red{``How can we show what the kingdom of God is like, or what parable can we use to describe it?} \v{31}\red{It's like a mustard seed planted in the ground. Although it's the smallest of\fnote{Or \fbib{smaller than}} all the seeds on earth,} \v{32}\red{when it's planted it comes up and becomes larger than all the garden plants. It grows such large branches that the birds in the sky can nest in its shade.''}
\passage{Why Jesus Used Parables}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 13:34-35)}

\v{33}With many other parables like these, Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} kept speaking his message to them according to their ability to understand. \v{34}He did not tell them anything without using\fnote{The Gk. lacks \fbib{using}} a parable, though he explained everything to his disciples in private.
\passage{Jesus Calms the Sea}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 8:23-27; Luke 8:22-25)}

\v{35}That day, when evening had come, he told them, \red{``Let's cross to the other side.''} \v{36}So they left the crowd and took him away in a boat without making any special preparations.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{boat just as he was}} Other boats were with him. \v{37}A violent windstorm came up, and the waves began breaking into the boat, so that the boat was rapidly\fnote{Lit. \fbib{already}} becoming swamped.

\v{38}But Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} was in the back of the boat, asleep on a cushion. So they woke him up and asked him, ``Teacher, don't you care that we're going to die?''

\v{39}Then he got up, rebuked the wind, and told the sea, \red{``Calm down! Be still!''} Then the wind stopped blowing, and there was a great calm. \v{40}He asked them, \red{``Why are you such cowards? Don't you have any faith yet?''}

\v{41}Overcome with fear, they kept saying to one another, ``Who is this man? Even the wind and the sea obey him!''

\passage{Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Man}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 8:28-34; Luke 8:26-39)}

\chapt{5}
\v{1}They arrived at the other side of the sea in the territory of the Gerasenes.\fnote{Other mss. read \fbib{Gergesenes}; still other mss. read \fbib{Gadarenes}} \v{2}Just as Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} stepped out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came out of the tombs and met him. \v{3}He lived among the tombs, and no one could restrain him any longer, not even with a chain. \v{4}He had often been restrained with shackles and chains, but had snapped the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one could tame him. \v{5}He kept screaming night and day among the tombs and on the mountainsides, and kept cutting himself with stones.

\v{6}When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell down in front of him, \v{7}screaming in a loud voice, ``What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you in the name of\fnote{The Gk. lacks \fbib{the name of}} God never to torment me!''

\v{8}Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Because he}} had been saying to him, \red{``Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!''} \v{9}Then Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} asked him, \red{``What's your name?''}

He told him, ``My name is Legion,\fnote{A Roman legion consisted of about 6,000 men.} because there are many of us.'' \v{10}He kept pleading with Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} not to send them out of that region.

\v{11}Now a large herd of pigs was grazing on a hillside nearby. \v{12}So the demons\fnote{Lit. \fbib{they}} begged him, ``Send us among the pigs, so that we can go into them!'' \v{13}So he let them do this. The unclean spirits came out of the man\fnote{The Gk. lacks \fbib{of the man}} and went into the pigs, and the herd of about 2,000 rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned there.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{drowned in the sea}}

\v{14}Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs ran away, they reported what had happened\fnote{Lit. \fbib{they reported it}} in the city and countryside.

\passage{Jesus Heals a Woman and Resurrects a Girl}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 9:18-26; Luke 8:40-56)}

\v{21}When Jesus again had crossed to the other side in a boat,\fnote{Other mss. lack \fbib{in a boat}} a large crowd gathered around him by the seashore. \v{22}Then a synagogue leader named Jairus arrived. When he saw Jesus,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} he fell at his feet \v{23}and begged him urgently, saying, ``My little daughter is dying. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may get well and live.'' \v{24}So Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} went with him. A huge crowd kept following him and jostling him.

\v{25}Now there was a woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years. \v{26}Although she had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all of her money, she had not been helped at all, but rather grew worse. \v{27}Since she had heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his robe, \v{28}because she had been saying, ``If I can just touch his robe, I will get well.'' \v{29}Her bleeding stopped at once, and she felt in her body that she was healed from her illness.

\v{30}Immediately Jesus became aware that power had gone out of him. So he turned around in the crowd and asked, \red{``Who touched my clothes?''}

\v{31}His disciples asked him, ``You see the crowd jostling you, and yet you ask, \red{`Who touched me?'}'' \v{32}But he kept looking around to look at the woman who had done this. \v{33}So the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came forward fearfully, fell down trembling in front of him, and told him the whole truth.

\v{34}He told her, \red{``Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be healed from your illness.''}

\v{35}While he was still speaking, some people\fnote{Lit. \fbib{they}} came from the synagogue leader's home\fnote{Lit. \fbib{from the synagogue leader}} and said, ``Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher anymore?''

\v{36}But when Jesus heard\fnote{Other mss. read \fbib{overheard}} what they said, he told the synagogue leader, \red{``Stop being afraid! Just keep on believing.''} \v{37}Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{He}} allowed no one to go further with him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.

\v{38}When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} saw mass confusion. People\fnote{Lit. \fbib{They}} were crying and sobbing loudly. \v{39}He entered the house\fnote{The Gk. lacks \fbib{the house}} and asked them, \red{``Why all this confusion and crying? The child isn't dead. She's sleeping.''} \v{40}They laughed and laughed at him. But when he had driven all of them outside, he took the child's father and mother, along with the men who were with him, and went into the room\fnote{The Gk. lacks \fbib{the room}} where the child was.

\v{41}He took her by the hand and told her, \red{``Talitha koum,''}\fnote{\fbib{Talitha Koum} is Heb./Aram. for \fbib{Little girl, get up!}} which means, \red{``Young lady, I tell you, get up!''} \v{42}The young lady got up at once and started to walk. She was twelve years old. Instantly they were overcome with astonishment. \v{43}But Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} strictly ordered them not to let anyone know about this. He also told them to give her something to eat.

\v{1}Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{He}} left that place and went back to his hometown,\fnote{I.e. Nazareth} and his disciples followed him. \v{2}When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were utterly amazed. ``Where did this man get all these things?'' they asked. ``What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What great miracles are being done by his hands! \v{3}This is the builder,\fnote{Or \fbib{carpenter}} the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon, isn't it? His sisters are here with us, aren't they?'' And they were offended by him.

\v{4}Jesus had been telling them, \red{``A prophet is without honor only in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own home.''} \v{5}He couldn't perform a miracle there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. \v{6}He was amazed at their unbelief.

\v{14}King Herod heard about this, because Jesus'\fnote{Lit. \fbib{his}} name had become well-known. He was\fnote{Other mss. read \fbib{They were}} saying, ``John the Baptist has been raised from the dead! That's why he is able to do these miracles.''

\v{15}Others were saying, ``He is Elijah.''

Still others were saying, ``He is a prophet like one of the other\fnote{The Gk. lacks \fbib{other}} prophets.''

\v{16}But when Herod heard about it, he said, ``John, whom I beheaded, has been raised,'' \v{17}because Herod himself had sent men who arrested\fnote{Lit. \fbib{sent and arrested}} John, bound him with chains, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom Herod\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} had married.

\v{18}John had been telling Herod, ``It's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.'' \v{19}So Herodias bore a grudge against John\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} and wanted to kill him. But she couldn't do it \v{20}because Herod was afraid of John. He knew that John\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} was a righteous and holy man, and so he protected him. Whenever he listened to John,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} he did much of what he said.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{did many things}; other mss. read \fbib{he became very disturbed}} In fact, he liked listening to him.

\v{21}An opportunity came during Herod's birthday celebration, when he gave a banquet for his top officials, military officers, and the most important people of Galilee. \v{22}When the daughter of Herodias\fnote{Other mss. read \fbib{his daughter by Herodias}} came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. So the king told the girl, ``Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.'' \v{23}He swore with an oath to her, ``I'll give you anything you ask for, up to half of my kingdom.''

\v{24}So she went out and asked her mother, ``What should I ask for?''

Her mother\fnote{Lit. \fbib{She}} replied, ``The head of John the Baptist.''

\v{25}Immediately the girl\fnote{Lit. \fbib{she}} hurried back to the king with her request, ``I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.''

\v{26}The king was deeply saddened, yet because of his oaths and his guests he was reluctant to refuse her. \v{27}So without delay the king sent a soldier and ordered him to bring John's\fnote{Lit. \fbib{his}} head. The soldier\fnote{Lit. \fbib{He}} went and beheaded him in prison. \v{28}Then he brought John's\fnote{Lit. \fbib{his}} head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. \v{29}When John's\fnote{Lit. \fbib{his}} disciples heard about this, they came and carried off his body and laid it in a tomb.

\v{51}Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped blowing. The disciples\fnote{Lit. \fbib{They}} were utterly astounded, \v{52}because they didn't understand the significance of the loaves. Instead, their hearts were hardened.

\v{31}In the same way, the high priests, along with the scribes, were also making fun of him among themselves. They kept saying, ``He saved others, but can't save himself! \v{32}Let the Messiah,\fnote{Or \fbib{Christ}} the king of Israel, come down from the cross now, since seeing is believing!'' Even the men who were crucified with him kept insulting him.

\v{33}At noon,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{At the sixth hour}} darkness came over the whole land\fnote{Or \fbib{earth}} until three in the afternoon.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{the ninth hour}} \v{34}At three o'clock,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{the ninth hour}} Jesus cried out with a loud voice, \red{``Eloi, eloi,\fnote{\fbib{Eloi, eloi} are Gk. transliterations for the Heb. \fbib{My God, my God} in Ps 22:1} lema sabachthani?''}\fnote{\fbib{lema sabachthani} is a Gk. transliteration for the Aram. rendering of the Heb. \fbib{in Ps 22:1, which means Why have you forsaken me?}} (which means, \red{``My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?''})\fnote{Cf. Ps 22:1}

\v{35}When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, ``Listen! He's calling for Elijah!''\fnote{\fbib{Elijah} in Heb. sounds like \fbib{Eloi}.}

\v{36}So someone ran and soaked a sponge in some sour wine. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} a drink, saying, ``Wait! Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down!''

\v{37}Then Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last. \v{38}The curtain\fnote{This curtain separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.} in the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom. \v{39}When the centurion\fnote{A Roman centurion commanded about 100 men.} who stood facing Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} saw how he had cried out and\fnote{Other mss. lack \fbib{cried out and}} breathed his last, he said, ``This man certainly was the Son of God!''

\v{40}Now there were women watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene,\fnote{Or \fbib{Mary of Magdala}} Mary the mother of young James and Joseph, and Salome. \v{41}They used to accompany him and care for him while he was in Galilee. Many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with him were there, too.

\v{42}It was the Day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath. Since it was already evening, \v{43}Joseph of Arimathea, a highly respected member of the Council,\fnote{Or \fbib{Sanhedrin}} who was waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. \v{44}Pilate was amazed to hear\fnote{The Gk. lacks \fbib{to hear}} that Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} had already died, so he summoned the centurion to ask him if he was in fact dead. \v{45}When he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he let Joseph have the corpse. \v{46}Joseph\fnote{Lit. \fbib{He}} bought some linen cloth, took the body\fnote{Lit. \fbib{it}} down, wrapped it in the cloth, laid it in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. \v{47}Now Mary Magdalene\fnote{Or \fbib{Mary of Magdala}} and Mary the mother of Joseph observed where the body\fnote{Lit. \fbib{where it}} had been laid.

\v{1}When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene,\fnote{Or \fbib{Mary of Magdala}} Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices to go and anoint Jesus.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} \v{2}Very early on the first day of the week,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{first of the Sabbaths}} when the sun had just come up, they were going to the tomb. \v{3}They kept saying to one another, ``Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?'' \v{4}Then they looked up and saw that the stone had been rolled away. (It was a very large stone.)

\v{5}As they went into the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were utterly astonished. \v{6}But he told them, ``Stop being astonished! You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised. He is not here. Look at the place where they laid him. \v{7}But go and tell his disciples---especially Peter---that Jesus\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.''

\v{8}So they left the tomb and ran away, overwhelmed by shock and astonishment. They didn't say a thing to anyone, because they were afraid.\fnote{Some mss. end Mark here; others include verses 9-20. Some mss. conclude the book with the following shorter ending (others include the shorter ending and then continue with verses 9-20): \fbib{They reported to those who were with Peter everything they had been commanded.

\v{14}Finally he appeared to his eleven disciples\fnote{The Gk. lacks \fbib{disciples}} while they were eating. He rebuked them for their unbelief and stubbornness, because they had not believed those who had seen him after he had risen. \v{15}Then he told them, \red{``As you go into the entire world, proclaim the gospel to everyone.}\fnote{Lit. \fbib{to the whole creation}} \v{16}\red{Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever doesn't believe will be condemned.} \v{17}\red{These are the signs that will accompany those who believe: In my name they'll drive out demons. they'll speak in new languages,}\fnote{Other mss. lack \fbib{with their hands}} \v{18}\red{and they'll pick up snakes with their hands.\fnote{Or \fbib{new tongues}}Even if they drink any deadly poison, it won't hurt them, and they'll place their hands on the sick, and they'll recover.''}
