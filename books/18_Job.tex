\passage{Job's Faithfulness}

\chapt{1}
\v{1}There once was a man in the land of Uz\fnote{I.e. a city east of Israel in Arabia; the name means \fbib{Wooded}} named Job. The man was blameless as well as upright. He feared God and kept away from evil. \v{2}Seven sons and three daughters had been born to him. \v{3}His livestock included 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 teams\fnote{Or \fbib{pairs}} of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and many servants. Indeed, the man's stature greatly exceeded that of many people who lived in the East. \v{4}His sons used to travel to each other's houses in turn on a regular schedule and hold festivals, inviting their three sisters to celebrate\fnote{Lit. \fbib{to eat and drink}} with them.

\v{5}When their time of feasting had concluded, Job would rise early in the morning to send for them\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{for them}} and consecrate them to God.\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{to God}} He would offer a burnt offering for each one,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{offering according to their number}} because Job thought, ``Perhaps my children sinned by cursing God in their hearts.'' Job did this time and again.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{all the days}}
\passage{Satan's First Attack on Job}

\v{6}One day, divine beings\fnote{Lit. \fbib{day, sons of God}} presented themselves to the \divine{Lord}, and Satan\fnote{The Heb. name \fbib{Satan} means \fbib{The Opponent} or \fbib{The Accuser}; and so throughout the book} accompanied them. \v{7}The \divine{Lord} asked Satan, ``Where have you come from?''

In response, Satan answered the \divine{Lord}, ``From wandering all over the earth and walking back and forth throughout it.''

\v{8}Then the \divine{Lord} asked Satan, ``Have you considered\fnote{Lit. \fbib{you set your heart over}} my servant Job? There is no one like him on earth. The man is blameless as well as upright. He fears God and keeps away from evil.''

\v{9}But in response, Satan asked the \divine{Lord}, ``Does Job fear God for nothing? \v{10}Haven't you surrounded him with a fence on all sides, around his house, and around all that he owns? You have blessed everything he puts his hands on and you have increased his livestock in the land. \v{11}However, stretch out your hand and strike everything he owns, and he will curse you to your face.''

\v{12}Then the \divine{Lord} told Satan, ``Very well then, everything he owns is under your control,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{hand}} only you may not extend your hand against him.'' So Satan left the \divine{Lord}'s presence.

\v{13}Some time later, when his children\fnote{Lit. \fbib{his sons and daughters}} were celebrating\fnote{Lit. \fbib{were eating and drinking wine}} in their oldest\fnote{Lit. \fbib{their firstborn}} brother's house, \v{14}a messenger approached Job and said, ``The oxen were plowing and the female donkeys were grazing nearby \v{15}when the Sabeans attacked, captured the servants, and killed them with swords. I alone escaped to tell you!''

\v{16}While this messenger\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{messenger}} was still speaking, another\fnote{Lit. \fbib{this}} came and announced, ``A lightning storm struck\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Fire of God fell from heaven}} and incinerated the flock and the servants while they were eating. I alone escaped to tell you!''

\v{17}While this messenger\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{messenger}} was still speaking, another\fnote{Lit. \fbib{this}} came and announced, ``The Chaldeans formed three companies, raided the camels, captured the servants, and killed them with swords. Only I alone escaped to tell you.''

\v{18}While this messenger\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{messenger}} was still speaking, another\fnote{Lit. \fbib{this}} came and announced, ``Your children were celebrating\fnote{Lit. \fbib{eating and drinking wine}} in their oldest\fnote{Lit. \fbib{their firstborn}} brother's house \v{19}when a strong wind came straight out of the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people, and they died. I alone escaped to tell you!''
\passage{Job Blesses God Despite the Catastrophe}

\v{20}Then Job stood up, tore his robe, shaved his head, fell to the ground, bowed very low, \v{21}and exclaimed:

\begin{poetry}
\poeml ``I left my mother's womb naked, \\
\poemll    and I will return to God naked. \\
\poeml The \divine{Lord} has given, \\
\poemll    and the \divine{Lord} has taken. \\
\poemlll       May the name of the \divine{Lord} be blessed.''
\end{poetry}

\v{22}Job neither sinned nor charged God with wrongdoing in all of this.
\labelchapt{2}
\passage{Satan's Second Attack on Job}

\chapt{2}
\v{1}Some time later, divine beings again\fnote{Lit. \fbib{later, the sons of God}} presented themselves to the \divine{Lord}, and Satan accompanied them to present himself to the \divine{Lord}. \v{2}The \divine{Lord} asked Satan, ``Where have you come from?''

In response, Satan told the \divine{Lord}, ``From wandering all over the earth and walking back and forth throughout it.''

\v{3}The \divine{Lord} asked Satan, ``Have you considered\fnote{Lit. \fbib{you set your heart over}} my servant Job? There is no one like him on earth. The man is blameless as well as upright. He fears God and keeps away from evil. He remains firm in his integrity, even though you have been urging me to overwhelm him without cause.''

\v{4}Satan answered the \divine{Lord}, ``Skin for skin! The man will give up everything that he owns in exchange for his health.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{his soul}} \v{5}However, stretch out your hand\fnote{Or \fbib{send judgment}} and strike his bones and flesh, and he'll curse you to your face, won't he?''

\v{6}Then the \divine{Lord} told Satan, ``Very well then, he is under your control.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{hand}} Just preserve his life.''\fnote{Lit. \fbib{his soul}}

\v{7}So Satan left the \divine{Lord}'s presence and struck Job with terrible boils from the sole of his feet to the top of his head. \v{8}Job\fnote{Lit. \fbib{He}} took a broken piece of pottery to scrape himself while sitting among the ashes.
\passage{Job Refuses to Curse God}

\v{9}Then his wife told him, ``Do you remain firm in your integrity? Curse God and die!''

\v{10}But he replied to her, ``You're talking like foolish women do. Are we to accept\fnote{Or \fbib{receive}} what is good from God but not tragedy?''

Throughout all of this, Job did not sin by what he said.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{by his lips}}
\passage{Job's Friends Visit}

\v{11}When Job's three friends heard all these tragedies that happened to him, they each traveled from their home towns\fnote{Lit. \fbib{from his place}} to visit him. Eliphaz came from Teman,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Eliphaz the Temanite}; i.e. from Teman in Edom, and so throughout the book} Bildad came from Shuah,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Bildad the Shuhite}; i.e. from Shuah, and so throughout the book} and Zophar came from Naamath.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Zophar the Naamathite}; i.e. from Naamath in Arabia, and so throughout the book} They met together and went to console and comfort him. \v{12}Observing him from a distance, at first they didn't even recognize him, so they raised their voices and burst into tears. They each ripped their robes, threw ashes into the air on their heads, \v{13}and sat with Job\fnote{Lit. \fbib{him}} on the ground for a full week\fnote{Lit. \fbib{for seven days and seven nights}} without saying a word, since they could see the great extent of his anguish.
\labelchapt{3}
\passage{Job Laments the Day He was Born}

\chapt{3}
\v{1}After this, Job spoke up solemnly, cursing\fnote{Or \fbib{Job opened his mouth and cursed}} the day he was born.\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{he was born}} \v{2}This is what Job said:

\begin{poetry}
\poeml \v{3}``Let the day when I was born be annihilated, \\

\poeml \v{4}Let that day be dark; \\
\poemll    let God above not care about it; \\
\poemlll       let no light shine over it. \\
\poeml \v{5}Let darkness and deep gloom reclaim it; \\
\poemll    let clouds settle down on it; \\
\poemlll       let blackness in mid-day terrify it. \\
\poeml \v{6}Let darkness carry that night away; \\
\poemll    let it not take its place joyfully among the days of the year; \\
\poemlll       let it not be entered into the calendar.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{entered among the numbering of months}} \\
\poeml \v{7}``Yes, let that night be barren; \\
\poemll    let it not appear with its joyful shout. \\
\poeml \v{8}Let whoever curses days curse it--- \\
\poemll    those who are ready to awaken monsters.\fnote{Lit. \fbib{Leviathan}; i.e. an ancient sea creature} \\
\poeml \v{9}Let the stars of its evening twilight be dark; \\
\poemll    let it hope for light but let there be none; \\
\poemlll       let it not see the breaking rays\fnote{Lit. \fbib{the eyelashes}} of the dawn. \\
\poeml \v{10}``Because that night\fnote{Lit. \fbib{It}} refused to shut the doors of my mother's\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{mother's}} womb; \\
\poemll    it failed to keep me from seeing this trouble. \\
\poeml \v{11}Why didn't I die while I was still in the womb, \\

\poeml \v{17}In that place, the wicked stop causing trouble, \\
\poemll    and there, those whose strength is exhausted are at rest. \\
\poeml \v{18}In that place, those who once were prisoners will be at ease together; \\
\poemll    they won't hear the voice of oppressors. \\
\poeml \v{19}The unimportant and the important are both there, \\
\poemll    and the servant is free from his master. \\
\poeml \v{20}``Why does God\fnote{Lit. \fbib{he}} give light to the sufferer \\
\poemll    or life to the bitter person: \\
\poeml \v{21}To those who are longing for death--- \\
\poemll    even though it does not come? \\
\poeml To those who search for it \\
\poemll    more than for hidden treasure? \\
\poeml \v{22}To those who are happy beyond measure\fnote{Lit. \fbib{happy with great rejoicing}} \\
\poemll    when they reach their graves? \\
\poeml \v{23}To the formerly successful\fnote{Lit. \fbib{the valiant}} man who lost his way in life, \\

\v{1}In reply, Eliphaz from Teman answered:
