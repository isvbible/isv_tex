\poeml \v{11}``On the day you just stood by,\fnote{Or \fbib{stood in opposition}} \\
\poeml when\fnote{Lit. \fbib{in the day}} strangers carried away Jacob's\fnote{Lit. \fbib{his}} wealth \\
\poeml and foreigners entered his gates, \\
\poemll    casting lots for Jerusalem, \\
\poeml you were just like one of them. \\
\poeml \v{12}``You should not have gloated over your brother,\fnote{Lit. \fbib{in the day of your brother}} \\
\poemll    on the day of his calamity. \\
\poeml You should not have rejoiced \\

\poeml \v{13}``You should not have entered the gate of my people \\
\poemll    on the day of their disaster.\fnote{The Heb. words \fbib{their disaster} may be a word play on the Heb. word \fbib{Edom}} \\
\poeml Also, you should not have gloated over Judah's\fnote{Lit. \fbib{his}} misfortune \\
\poemll    on the day of his disaster,\fnote{The Heb. words \fbib{his disaster} may be a word play on the Heb. word \fbib{Edom}} \\

\poemll    on the day of his disaster.\fnote{The Heb. words \fbib{his disaster} may be a word play on the Heb. word \fbib{Edom}} \\
\poeml \v{14}And you should not have taken your stand at the crossroads \\

\poemll    on the day of his distress.''
\passage{The \divine{Lord}'s Judgment and Israel's Final Victory}

\poemll    As you have done it will be done to you--- \\
\poemlll       your deeds will return to haunt you!\fnote{Lit. \fbib{return on your own head}} \\
\poeml \v{16}Just as you have drunk from the cup of my wrath\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{from the cup of my wrath}} upon my holy mountain, \\
\poemll    so will all nations drink from the cup of my wrath\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{from the cup of my wrath}} perpetually. \\
\poeml They will drink, they will gulp it down, \\
\poemll    and they will be as if they had never existed! \\
\poeml \v{17}``But there will be a delivered remnant on Mount Zion. \\
\poemll    There will be holiness, \\
\poemlll       and the house of Jacob will take back their possessions. \\
\poeml \v{18}``The house of Jacob will be a fire, \\
\poeml and the house of Joseph a flame, \\
\poemll    but the house of Esau will be kindling. \\

\poeml \v{19}``Those in the Negev\fnote{I.e. the southern regions of the Sinai peninsula; cf. Josh 10:40} will possess Esau's Mountain, \\
\poemll    and those in the Shephelah\fnote{I.e. the verdant central lowlands of Israel; cf. Josh 10:40} the Philistines. \\
\poeml They will possess the fields of Ephraim \\
\poemll    and the fields of Samaria, \\
\poeml while Benjamin will possess the territory of\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{will possess the territory of}} Gilead. \\
\poeml \v{20}The exiles, the Israeli host, \\
\poemll    will possess the territory of the\fnote{The Heb. lacks \fbib{the territory of}} Canaanites all the way to Zarephath. \\
\poeml The exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad\fnote{I.e. perhaps Sardis, capital of Lydia, Saparda in eastern Assyria, Sparta in Greece, or a location in Spain (so \fbib{Targ of Jonathan})} \\
\poemll    will possess the cities of the Negev.\fnote{I.e. the southern regions of the Sinai peninsula; cf. Josh 10:40} \\
\poeml \v{21}Deliverers will assemble on Mount Zion to judge Esau's Mountain, \\
\poemll    and to the \divine{Lord} will the kingdom belong!''\end{poetry}
